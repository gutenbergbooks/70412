<h1>SECULAR ANNOTATIONS<br>
<span class="smaller">ON</span><br>
SCRIPTURE TEXTS.</h1>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 9.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/line1.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FELLOWSHIP_IN_ACHANS_FALL"><i>FELLOWSHIP IN ACHAN’S FALL.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Joshua</span> xxii. 20.</p>

</div>

<p>When Achan the son of Zerah committed a trespass in
the accursed thing, wrath fell not alone upon Achan,
but upon all the congregation of Israel; “and that man
perished not alone in his iniquity.” The text is one to arrest
the thoughtless, and to suggest even to the most thoughtful
matter for very serious consideration.</p>

<p>“Should one man sin, and would God be wroth with all the
congregation?” That deprecatory question had been put
twenty years before Achan’s trespass, by the congregation of
Israel, in the matter of Korah, when they fell upon their faces
and pleaded with God, the God of the spirits of all flesh.
And some centuries later the confession of King David in
time of pestilence took this form: that he had sinned and done
wickedly; but those sheep—those subjects of his, involved in
the penalty of his transgression, and dying off like sheep in a
flock to the right and left of him, seventy thousand of them
from morning to evening, from Dan even to Beersheba,—what
had they done?</p>

<p>If, indeed, says Dr. South, a man could be wicked and a
villain to himself alone, the mischief would be so much the
more tolerable. But the case, as he goes on to show, is much
otherwise: the guilt of the crime lights upon one, but the
example of it sways a multitude; especially if the criminal be
of any note or eminence in the world. “For the fall of such
a one by any temptation (be it never so plausible) is like that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
of a principal stone or stately pillar, tumbling from a lofty
edifice into the deep mire of the street; it does not only plunge
and sink into the black dirt itself, but also dashes or bespatters
all that are about it or near it when it falls.” It is by no very
subtle and far-fetched reasoning that a living divine essays to
show that we may sin in the persons of other men, and so may
sin in other countries which we never saw, and in years after
we are in our graves. For may we not, he asks, be partakers in
other men’s sins of which at their commission we knew not,
indeed at whose commission we would shudder? May we
not in the moral world sometimes set the great stone rolling
down the hill, with little thought of the ruin it may deal below?
“Ah, you may live after you are dead, to do mischief; live in
the evil thoughts you instilled, the false doctrines you taught,
the perverted character you helped to form.” And just as a
righteous exemplar, “being dead, yet speaketh,” and is a
living means of good ages after he has been in his grave, “so
may you, insignificant though you be, have left some impress
of yourself upon minds more powerful than your own, and so
be exercising a power to do harm to people you have never
heard of, years after you are dead.” Thus it is that far down
into unknown time, and far away into the unknown distance,
the moral contagion of our sin may be proved to spread; so
that we may still be incurring guilt after the green turf is over
us, and in lands which we have never seen and shall never see.
“The evil principle we instilled, the evil example we set, may
ripen into bitter fruit in the murderous blow which shall be
dealt a century hence upon Australian plains!” Well may the
note of exclamation follow: how strange, yet how inevitable,
the tie which may link our uneventful life with the stormy
passions of numbers far away! More wonderful than even the
Atlantic cable is declared to be that unknown fibre, along
which, from other men’s sins, responsibility may thrill even to
our departed souls: “a chain whose links are formed perhaps
of idle words, of forgotten looks, of phrases of double meaning,
of bad advice, of cynical sentiment hardly seriously meant;
yet carried on through life after life, through soul after soul,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
till the little seed of evil sown by you has developed into some
deed of guilt at which you shudder, but from participation in
responsibility for which you cannot clear yourself.” Every sin,
we are in fine reminded, may waken its echo; every sin is
reduplicated and reiterated in other souls and lives.</p>

<p>A distinguished French preacher, of the Reformed faith, has
a striking discourse on what he entitles the <i>solidarity</i> of evil;
and he too dilates upon the mysterious links which connect
together persons and acts that appear to have nothing in
common,—suggesting melancholy examples of the contagion
of guilt and its consequences, of the expansive power of corruption
and its almost boundless results.</p>

<p>Our most powerful female writer of fiction has emphatically
taught, if a striking story can teach, that there is no sort of
wrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone;
you can’t isolate yourself, and say that the evil which is in you
shall not spread. Men’s lives are as thoroughly blended with
each other as the air they breathe; evil spreads as necessarily
as disease. “I know, I feel the terrible extent of suffering
this sin of Arthur’s has caused to others,”—so the good rector
tells one who cherishes vengeance on the wrong-doer; “but
so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who
commit it.” The problem how far a man is to be held
responsible for the unforeseen consequences of his own deed
this speaker pronounces to be one that might well make us
tremble to look into it; the evil consequences that may lie
folded in a single act of selfish indulgence being a thought
so awful that it ought surely to awaken some feeling less presumptuous
than a rash and vindictive desire to punish.</p>

<p>In another of her books the same authoress takes pains to
prove how deeply inherent it is in this life of ours that men
have to suffer for each other’s sins; so inevitably diffusive is
human suffering that we can conceive no retribution which
does not spread beyond its mark in pulsations of unmerited
pain.</p>

<p>There is a passage in one of Madame de Charrière’s letters
in which, avowing her full recognition of the fact that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
must pay in person for the costly experience of life, she expresses
the futile wish that others might not have to share in
the costs, but owns with a sigh that the wish <i>is</i> futile, for
one does nothing absolutely alone she says, and nothing so
happens to us as to entirely exclude the participation of
others: “<i>On ne fait rien tout seul, et il ne nous arrive rien à
nous seuls.</i>” We are taught by modern science that the
slightest movement, of the smallest body, in the remotest
region, produces results which are perpetual, which diffuse
themselves through all space, and which, though they may be
metamorphosed, cannot be destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Or again, as Mrs.
Browning reminds us,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Each creature holds an insular point in space:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet what man stirs a finger, breathes a sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But all the multitudinous beings round,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In all the countless worlds, with time and place</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For their conditions, down to the central base,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrill, haply, in vibration and rebound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life answering life across the vast profound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In full antiphony....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If no good work that a man does is lost—the smallest useful
work, as an octogenarian essayist assures us, continuing to be
useful long after the man is dead and forgotten, so neither do
bad actions die with the doer. “Future generations suffer
for the sin of their ancestors, and one great crime or act of
folly causes the misery of unborn millions.” So all things, it
is added, hang together in one unbroken chain, of which we
see a few links, but the beginning and the end we see not
and never shall see.</p>

<p>Seneca was writing for all time when he said that no man’s
error is confined to himself, but affects all around him, whether
by example, or consequences, or both: “<i>nemo errat uni sibi</i>.”
A latter-day philosopher assigns to a place among the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
insoluble riddles propounded to mortal comprehension what
he calls the fatal decree by which every crime is made to be
the agony of many innocent persons as well as of the single
guilty one. “Ah!” exclaims Hilda to guilty Miriam, in the
story of “Transformation,”—“now I understand how the sins
of generations past have created an atmosphere of sin for
those that follow. While there is a single guilty person in the
universe, each innocent one must feel his innocence tortured
by that guilt. Your deed, Miriam, has darkened the whole
sky!” To apply the lines of a reflective poet,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis not their own crimes only, men commit;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They harrow them into another’s breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they shall reap the growth with bitter pain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Very forcibly Mr. Isaac Taylor warns us that in almost
every event of life the remote consequences vastly outweigh
the proximate in actual amount of importance; and he undertakes
to show, on principles even of mathematical calculation,
that each individual of the human family holds in his hand
the centre lines of an interminable web-work, on which are
sustained the fortunes of multitudes of his successors; the
implicated consequences, if summed together, making up
therefore a weight of human weal or woe that is reflected
back with an incalculable momentum upon the lot of each.
The practical conclusion is that every one is bound to remember
that the personal sufferings or peculiar vicissitudes
or toils through which he is called to pass are to be estimated
and explained only in an immeasurably small proportion if
his single welfare is regarded, while their “full price and value
are not to be computed unless the drops of the morning dew
could be numbered.” So the most popular of domestic story-tellers
expatiates in an early work on the impossibility of
wiping off from us, as with a wet cloth, the stains left by the
fault of those who are near to us. Another of the tribe, but
more “sensational” in subject and style, is keen to show how
the influence of a man’s evil deed slowly percolates through
insidious channels of which he never dreams; how the deed
of folly or of guilt is still active for evil when the sinner who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
committed it has forgotten his wickedness. “Who shall say
where or when the results of one man’s evil-doing shall cease?
The seed of sin engenders no common root, shooting straight
upwards through the earth, and bearing a given crop. It is
the germ of a foul running weed, whose straggling suckers
travel underground beyond the ken of mortal eye, beyond
the power of mortal calculation.” And so again the caustic
showman of “Vanity Fair,” in his last completed work,
paused to explain how a culprit’s evil behaviour of five
and twenty years back, brought present grief and loss of
rest to three unoffending persons; and he characteristically
utters the wistful wish that we “could all take the punishment
for our individual crimes on our individual shoulders,”
but laments the futility of any such wish, recognising as he
does so plainly that when the culprit is condemned to hang,
it is those connected with him who have to weep and suffer,
and wear piteous mourning in their hearts long after he has
jumped off the Tyburn ladder.</p>

<p>We conclude with a suggestive stanza of Mr. Robert
Browning’s, worth learning by heart in more senses than one:
he is speaking of the soul declaring itself by its fruit—the
thing it does:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be Hate that fruit, or Love that fruit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It forwards the general deed of Man;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And each of the many helps to recruit</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The life of the race by a general plan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each living his own, to boot.”</div>
  </div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SILENT_SYMPATHY"><i>SILENT SYMPATHY.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Job</span> ii. 13.</p>

</div>

<p>Job’s friends have long since been a sort of bye-word. But
be it not forgotten that the friendship of Eliphaz, Bildad,
and Zophar, to the ruined and desolate man of Uz,
evidences itself as very genuine in one or two salient points,
before it came to be, what it is apt to be now exclusively considered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
all talk. Before the talk there was prolonged silence;
and before the silence there was lamentation of undoubted
earnest. Coming from afar to mourn with him, and to comfort
him, from afar off they caught sight of him, but so altered—<i>heu,
quantum mutatus!</i>—that they lifted up their voice and
wept; and they rent each one his mantle, and sprinkled dust
upon their heads towards heaven. And then they “sat down
with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, <i>and
none spake a word unto him</i>; for they saw that his grief was
very great.”</p>

<p>The sonnet of a Quaker poet has thus far vindicated the
sincerity of their friendship, and on the ground of their silent
sympathy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“However ye might err in after-speech,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The mute expression of that voiceless woe</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whereby ye sought your sympathy to show</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With him of Uz, doth eloquently preach,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teaching a lesson it were well to teach</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Some comforters, of utterance less slow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Prone to believe that they more promptly know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grief’s mighty depths, and by their words can reach.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Seven days and nights</i>, in stillness as profound</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As that of chaos, patiently ye sate</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">By the heart-stricken and the desolate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And though your sympathy might fail to sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fathomless depth of his dark spirit’s wound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Not less your silence was sublimely great.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In his vivid picture of the desolation of a bereaved husband,
Sir Richard Steele goes on to say, “I knew consolation would
now be impertinent; and therefore contented myself to sit by
him, and condole with him in silence.” “<i>Les consolations indiscrètes</i>,”
says Rousseau, “<i>ne font qu’aigrir les violentes afflictions.
L’indifférence et la froideur trouvent aisément des paroles, mais
la tristesse et <span class="smcap">le silence</span> sont alors le vrai langage de l’amitié</i>.”
Gray writes to Mason, while yet uncertain whether the latter
is already a widower or not,—“If the last struggle be over
... allow me (at least in idea, for what could I do were I
present more than this,) to sit by you in silence, and pity from
my heart, not her who is at rest, but you who lose her.” So it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
happened that Mason received this little billet at almost the
precise moment when it would be most affecting.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, again, writes to an afflicted correspondent,—“I
say no more, for time only, not words, can soften such
afflictions, nor can any consolations be suggested, that do not
more immediately occur to the persons afflicted. To moralize
can comfort those only who do not want to be comforted.”
So Marcia replies to Lucia, in Addison’s tragedy:</p>

<p class="noindent">Words are words, says Shakspeare’s Brabantio, and never
yet heard he that the bruised heart was relieved through
the ear. When, towards the close of Campbell’s metrical tale
of fair Wyoming, on Susquehanna’s side, “prone to the dust,
afflicted Waldegrave hid his face on earth, him watched, in
gloomy ruth, his woodland guide; but words had none to
soothe the grief that knows not consolation’s name.” But the
Oneyda chief was not on that account Waldegrave’s least efficient
comforter. What though others around him, less reticent,
and more demonstrative, found utterance easy, and shaped
their kind common-place meaning into kind common-place
words? “Of them that stood encircling his despair, he heard
some friendly words, but knew not what they were.” Wise-hearted,
too, was Southey’s young Arabian, in watching silently
the frantic grief of the newly childless old diviner: in pitying
silence Thalaba stood by, and gazed, and listened: “not with
the officious hand of consolation, fretting the sore wound he
could not hope to heal.” It has been called the last triumph
of affection and magnanimity, when a loving heart can respect
the suffering silence of its beloved, and allow that lonely liberty
in which alone some natures can find comfort. A late author
portrayed in one of his tales a dull, common-place fellow
enough, of limited intellect and attainments, whose, however,
was one of those kind and honest natures fortunately endowed
with subtle powers of perception that lie deeper than the head.
Accordingly he is described, in the capacity of an unofficious
condoler, as appreciating perfectly the grief of his friend; at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
his side throughout the day, but never obtruding himself, never
attempting jarring platitudes of condolence: “in a word he
fully understood the deep and beautiful sympathy of silence.”
So with Adela and Caroline in <i>The Bertrams</i>,—interchanging
those pressures of the hand, those mute marks of fellow-feeling,
“which we all know so well how to give when we long to
lighten the sorrows which are too deep to be probed by words.”
But though we all may know so well how to give these mute
marks, we do not all and always practice what we know. ’Tis
true, ’tis pity; pity ’tis ’tis true.</p>

<p>Adam Bede’s outburst of maddened feelings, uttered in tones
of appealing anguish, when the loss of Hetty is first made
clear to him, is noted in silence by the discreet rector, who is
too wise to utter soothing words at present, as he watches in
Adam that look of sudden age which sometimes comes over
a young face in moments of terrible emotion. As Bartle
Massey elsewhere describes this silent sympathizer, “Ay, he’s
good metal; ... says no more than’s needful. He’s not
one of those that think they can comfort you with chattering,
as if folks who stand by and look on knew a deal better what
the trouble was than those who have to bear it.”</p>

<p>Madame de Sévigné frankly deposes of her capacity as regards

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TEMPTERS_IT_IS_WRITTEN"><i>THE TEMPTER’S “IT IS WRITTEN.”</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Matthew</span> iv. 6.</p>

</div>

<p>“It is written,” said the Tempter, quoting Scripture for
his purpose, when it was his hour and the power of
darkness, in the day of temptation in the wilderness. The
quotation was refuted on the spot, and the Tempter was foiled.
But his failure has not deterred mankind, at sundry times and
in divers manners, from venturing on the same appeal, with no
very unlike design. The wise as serpents (there was a serpent
in Eden) who are not also harmless as doves, have now and
then essayed to round a sophistic period, or clench an immoral
argument, with an <i>It is written</i>.</p>

<p>Among the crowd of pilgrims who throng the pages of his
allegory, Bunyan depicts one Mr. Selfwill, who holds that a
man may follow the vices as well as the virtues of pilgrims;
and that if he does both, he shall certainly be saved. But
what ground has he for so saying? is Mr. Greatheart’s query.
And old Mr. Honesty replies, “Why, he said he had Scripture
for his warrant.” He could cite David’s practice in one bad
direction, and Sarah’s lying in another, and Jacob’s dissimulation
in a third. And what they did, he might do too. “I
have heard him plead for it, bring Scripture for it, bring arguments
for it,” etc., quoth old Honesty with a degree of indignation
that does credit to his name.</p>

<p>A Dublin synod of the Irish Roman Catholic bishops, a few
years since, which distinguished itself by its enthusiasm for
Pope Pius IX., against the King of Italy, and by its arrogation
of a divine right of practical monopoly in overseeing the schools
and colleges of Ireland, was made the theme of comment by
unsympathetic British critics; who remarked that when the
question of education is stirred in such quarters, the dullest
heretic can divine that the national system is to be denounced;
and that it is easy to guess at the text of Scripture to be quoted
in support of the pretensions of the Church. “The command
to ‘go and teach all nations’ vested in the successors of the
Apostles a rightful monopoly of instruction in Greek, mathematics,
and civil engineering.” According to the same elastic
authority, the “Puritans,” we are reminded, were justified in
shooting and hanging their enemies, because Samuel hewed
Agag in pieces, or because Phineas arose and executed judgment.
“There never was a proposition which could not be
proved by a text; and perhaps the effect is more complete
when the citation is taken from the Vulgate.” Gray’s malicious
lines against Lord Sandwich, a notorious evil-liver, as candidate
for the High Stewardship in the University of Cambridge,
include this stanza, supposed to be uttered by a representative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
D.D., of the old port-wine school, and a staunch supporter of
his profligate lordship:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Did not Israel filch from th’ Egyptians of old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their jewels of silver and jewels of gold?</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gray’s <i>jeu d’esprit</i> was, throughout, not in the best of taste;
but it was vastly relished at the time, as an election squib.
The reference to spoiling the Egyptians is a well worked one
in the history of quotations. Coleridge has a story of a
Mameluke Bey, whose “precious logic” extorted a large contribution
from the Egyptian Jews. “These books, the Pentateuch,
are authentic?” “Yes.” “Well, the debt then is
acknowledged: and now the receipt, or the money, or your
heads! The Jews borrowed a large treasure from the Egyptians;
but you are the Jews, and on you, therefore, I call for
the repayment.” Such conclusions, from such premises, and
backed by such vouchers, are open to logicians of every order,
sacred and profane.</p>

<p>There was a time in the life of Diderot when that freest of
free-thinkers made a living, such as it was, by writing sermons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
to order—half a dozen of them, for instance, a missionary bespoke
for the Portuguese colonies, and is said to have paid for
them very handsomely at fifty crowns each. Mr. Carlyle is
caustic in his commemoration of this incident in Denis Diderot’s
career. “Further, he made sermons, to order; as the Devil is
said to quote Scripture.” In Mr. Carlyle’s latest and longest
history, we find once and again the like allusion. Frederick
William, and his advisers, bent on a certain match for the
Princess Wilhelmina, which the queen, her mother, as steadfastly
opposed, took to quoting Scripture by way of subduing
her majesty’s resistance. “There was much discourse, suasive,
argumentative. Grumkow quoting Scripture on her majesty,
as the devil can on occasion,” says Wilhelmina. “Express
scriptures, ‘Wives, be obedient to your husbands,’ and the like
texts; but her majesty, on the Scripture side, too, gave him as
much as he brought.” And at a later stage of the negotiation,
the same Grumkow appears again, citing the Vulgate to a confidential
correspondent, in reference to their political schemings.
“But ‘<i>Si Deus est nobiscum</i>’—‘If God be for us, who can be
against us?’ For the Grumkow can quote Scripture; nay,
solaces himself with it, which is a feat beyond what the devil is
competent to.” Shakespeare embodies in Richard of Gloster
a type of the political intriguer of this complexion; as where
that usurper thus answers the gulled associates who urge him to
be avenged on the opposite faction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But then I sigh, and with a piece of Scripture,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell them, that God bids us do good for evil.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thus I clothe my naked villany</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With old odd ends, stolen forth of holy writ;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And seem a saint when most I play the devil.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An unmitigated scoundrel in one of Mr. Dickens’s books is
represented as overtly grudging his old father the scant remnant
of his days, and citing holy writ for sanction of his complaint.
“Why, a man of any feeling ought to be ashamed of being eighty—let
alone any more. Where’s his religion, I should like to
know, when he goes flying in the face of the Bible like that?
Threescore and ten’s the mark; and no man with a conscience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
and a proper sense of what’s expected of him, has any business
to live longer.” Whereupon the author interposes this parenthetical
comment, and highly characteristic it is: “Is any one
surprised at Mr. Jonas making such a reference to such a book
for such a purpose? Does any one doubt the old saw that
the devil ... quotes Scripture for his own ends? If he
will take the trouble to look about him, he may find a greater
number of confirmations of the fact in the occurrences of a
single day than the steam-gun can discharge balls in a minute.”
Fiction would supply us with abundant illustrations—fiction in
general, and Sir Walter Scott in particular. As where Simon
of Hackburn, the martial borderer, backs his hot appeal to
arms, for the avenging a deed of wrong, by an equivocal reference
to holy writ. “Let women sit and greet at hame, men
must do as they have been done by; it is the Scripture says it.”
“Haud your tongue, sir,” exclaims one of the seniors, sternly;
“dinna abuse the Word that gate; ye dinna ken what ye speak
about.” Or as where the Templar essays to corrupt the Jewess
by citing the examples of David and Solomon: “If thou readest
the Scriptures,” retorts Rebecca, “and the lives of the saints,
only to justify thine own licence and profligacy, thy crime is
like that of him who extracteth poison from the most healthful
and necessary herbs.” One other example. Undy Scott, that
plausible scamp of Mr. Trollope’s making, propounds an
immoral paradox, to the scope of which one of his dupes is
bold enough to object. But how is the objector disposed of?
“‘Judge not, and ye shall not be judged,’ said Undy, quoting
Scripture, as the devil did before him.” Dupes can quote
Scripture, too, and perhaps that is more demoralizing still.
For Cowper did not rhyme without reason when he declared,
that</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROYALTY_REMINDED_OF_THE_POOR"><i>ROYALTY REMINDED OF THE POOR.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> iv. 27.</p>

</div>

<p>Great was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, even as the
tree that he saw in his dream; for, by the avowal of the
Hebrew prophet who interpreted that dream, the king was
indeed become strong, and his greatness was grown, and
reached unto the heaven, and his dominion unto the ends of the
earth. But sentence had gone forth, as against the tree, so
against the king. Nebuchadnezzar was to be degraded;
despoiled of his kingdom, cast down from his throne, and
driven from men, to eat grass as oxen. This counsel, however,
the prophet urged upon the sovran, that he should break off
his sins by righteousness, and his “iniquities by showing mercy
to the poor”; if it might be a lengthening of his tranquillity, or
a healing of his error.</p>

<p>What error? That of which ex-king Lear accused himself,
when he owned, amid words of frenzy, all however with more
or less of tragic significance in them, that he had taken too
little care of <i>this</i>,—of sympathy with desolate indigence, and of
readiness to relieve the sufferings of the destitute and forlorn.</p>

<p>The storm is raging on the heath, and faithful Kent implores
his aged master to take shelter, such as it is, within a hovel hard
by; some friendship will it lend him against the tempest; the
tyranny of the open night’s too rough for nature to endure.
But Lear would be let alone. “Wilt break my heart?” he
exclaims, in answer to Kent’s fresh entreaty: Kent had rather
break his own. Again the drenched, discrowned old man is
urged to enter the hovel on the heath. But he stays outside,
to reason on his past and present, till reason gives way. Kent
may think it a matter of moment that this contentious storm
invades them to the skin; and so it is to him. But Lear has
deeper griefs to shatter him; and “where the greater malady is
fixed, the lesser is scarce felt.” Let Kent go in, by all means:
the king enjoins it—at least the ex-king desires it: let Kent
seek his own ease—and perhaps Lear will follow him in. Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
in draggling robes, drenched to the skin, chilled to the
heart, Lear’s thoughts perforce are turned to “houseless
poverty,” to the indigent and vagrant creatures once, and so
lately, his subjects, equally exposed to the downpour of the
wrathful skies, of whom he had seldom, if ever, thought till
now. Poor naked wretches, he apostrophises them, wheresoever
they are, that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,—how
shall their houseless heads, and unfed sides, their looped and
windowed raggedness, defend them from seasons such as
these? And then, in an outburst of repentant self-reproach,
he that had been King of Britain breaks forth into the avowal,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">“O, I have ta’en</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And show the heavens more just.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Between the history of Lear and that of Gloster, in the same
play, there is a curious and significant parallel maintained
throughout. And it is observable that when Gloster too,
another duped and outcast father, is wandering in his turn on
the same heath, and is accosted by “poor mad Tom,”—the
sightless, miserable father thus addresses the “naked fellow”
whose identity he so little suspects:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here, take this purse, thou whom the heaven’s plagues</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes thee the happier:—Heavens, deal so still!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That slaves your ordinance, that will not see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So distribution should undo the excess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And each man have enough.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Strictly a parallel passage to the one just cited from the lips of
Lear, even as the disastrous personal experiences of King of
Britain and Duke of Gloster were along parallel lines, as we
have said.</p>

<p>The words of Amos, the herdman of Tekoa, include a denunciation
of woe to them that lie upon beds of ivory, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst
of the stall, and drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves
with costly ointments, and chant to the sound of the viol,—but
are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. As the minor
prophet with his woe to them that are thus at ease in Zion, so
a major prophet declares this to have been the iniquity of a
doomed race—pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness,
with disregard of all means to strengthen the hand of the
poor and needy. Lazarus the beggar was, as some scholars
interpret the passage, “content to be fed” on the crumbs
which fell from the rich man’s table; in which case he would
not appear to have been refused the crumbs: indeed, had this
been the case, it would scarcely, they contend, have been
omitted in the rebuke of Abraham. “The rich man’s sins
were ravenousness and negligence rather than inhumanity.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
He took too little care of this—that beggary lay in helpless
prostration before his doorway, the while he clothed himself in
purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day.</p>

<p>La Bruyère observes that “la santé et les richesses ôtent
aux hommes l’expérience du mal, leur inspirent la dureté pour
leurs semblables;” and adds, that “les gens déjà chargés de
leur propre misère sont ceux qui entrent davantage, par leur
compassion, dans celle d’autrui.” If these by comparison become
wondrous kind, it is their fellow-feeling that makes them
so. <i>Haud ignari mali, miseris succurrere discunt.</i> In another
chapter of his “Characters,” La Bruyère sketches the portrait
of one he styles Champagne, who “au sortir d’un long dîner
qui lui enfle l’estomac, et dans les douces fumées d’un vin
d’Avenay ou de Sillery, signe un ordre qu’on lui présente, qui
ôterait le pain à toute une province, si l’on n’y remédiait: il
est excusable. Quel moyen de comprendre, dans la première
heure de la digestion, qu’on puisse quelque part mourir de
faim?” <i>Il est excusable</i>, on the principle of Horace Walpole’s
similar plea, or apology, for unheeding royalty. He writes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Miss Hannah More that he used to hate that king and t’other
prince—but that on reflection he found the censure ought to
fall on human nature in general. “They are made of the
same stuff as we, and dare we say what we should be in their
situation? Poor creatures! think how they are educated, or
rather corrupted, early, how flattered! To be educated properly,
they should be led through hovels [as Lear was on the
heath—somewhat late in life], and hospitals, and prisons.
Instead of being reprimanded (and perhaps immediately afterwards
<i>sugar-plum’d</i>) for not learning their Latin or French
grammar, they now and then should be kept fasting; and, if
they cut their finger, should have no plaster till it festered.
No part of a royal brat’s memory, which is good enough,
should be burthened but with the remembrance of human
suffering.” “<i>Il y a une espèce de honte d’être heureux à la vue de
certaines misères</i>,” writes La Bruyère again. Adam Smith, however,
made a dead set against what he calls those “whining and
melancholy moralists,” who he complains, are perpetually reproaching
us with our happiness, while so many of our brethren
are in misery, who regard as impious the natural joy of
prosperity, which does not think of the many wretches that are
at every instant labouring under all sorts of calamities, in the
languor of poverty, in the agony of disease, etc. “Commiseration
for those miseries which we never saw, which we never
heard of, but which we may be assured are at all times infesting
such numbers of our fellow-creatures, ought, they think, to
damp the pleasures of the fortunate, and to render a certain
melancholy dejection habitual to all men.” Adam Smith opposes
this “extreme sympathy” as altogether absurd and unreasonable;
as unattainable too, so that a certain affected and
sentimental sadness is the nearest approach that can be made
to it; and he further declares that this disposition of mind,
though it could be attained, would be perfectly useless, and
could serve no other purpose than to render miserable the
person who possessed it. This, of course, is assuming the
wretchedness in question to be beyond the sympathiser’s relief.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Dr. Smith may be supposed to have had in view Thomson’s
celebrated passage:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Ah! little think the gay licentious proud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom pleasure, power, and affluence surround;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They, who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wanton, often cruel, riot waste;</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Many variations on that theme of sad variety the poet sings:
moving accidents by flood and fire,—pining want, and dungeon
glooms,—the many who drink the cup of baleful grief, or
eat the bitter bread of misery—sore pierced by wintry winds,

<p class="noindent">Again and again the question recurs, to quote from an able
casuist on casual charity, why one man should be literally
dying of want, whilst another is able to send him a cheque for
£100 without thinking about it, or knowing that the money is
gone? If Dives, it is asked, feels bound to give Lazarus so
much, where does he draw the line? If the demand upon the
superfluities of the rich is to be measured by the wants of the
poor, why stop at £100 rather than £1000 or £10,000 or
£100,000? “This is the question which lies at the root of
half the melancholy sarcasms and still more melancholy wit of
the present day. The writings of such men as Hood are little
more than embodiments of it in a variety of forms, ludicrous or
pathetic. It forms the burden of a whole class of literature,
not the less influential because it is somewhat vague in its
doctrines, and rests rather on sentiments than on dogmas.”
Now this writer believes it to be always the best to look such
questions in the face, and to attempt at least to give the true
answer to them. And the answer, at least in part, in this
instance, he takes to be that the antithesis is only sentimental,
and not logical. The poverty of the very poor is not, he
contends, either a cause or an effect of the riches of the very
rich, nor would it be relieved by their permanent impoverishment.
“That it is not a cause of their riches, is obvious from
the fact that if by any change pauperism and misery were
suddenly abolished, the rich would be all the richer.” But not
to follow out a line of argument that would take us too far
afield, we may advert to a corresponding essay, in the same
<i>Review</i>, if not by the same contributor,—in which a picture is
drawn of a rich man at church, who hears some stray verses in
the second lesson, or some eloquent menace from the pulpit,
which makes him very uncomfortable about the contrast between
his own easy life and the massive wretchedness of
Spitalfields or Poplar. The uneasiness is supposed to rankle
in him for some time, spoiling his digestion, and making him
very cross to his wife and daughters. Not that he “for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
moment dreams of literally obeying the texts in the New Testament
that have hit him hard; for he has a shrewd notion that
they imply a very different state of society from the busy
nineteenth century. He feels that he has no time for visiting
the sick, and that if he had, the sick would think him a great
nuisance; and he knows that when he got to the bedside, he
would probably be at his wits’ ends for anything to say, and
would end by twisting his watch-chain, and remarking that it
was a cold day.” The practical inference is, that if he is to do
any of the corporal works of mercy, he must do them by commission;—and
so, at last, the irritation in his conscience throws
itself out in the form of a liberal cheque upon his bankers.
<i>He</i>, at least, will vindicate himself, so far as that vicarious
beneficence may avail, from any possible charge of branded
fellowship with such as the poet of the Seasons depicts, in</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, on being complimented by letter on the
patience with which he bore an acute attack of his chronic
malady, replies: “If people of easy fortunes cannot bear illness
with temper, what are the poor to do, who have none of our
comforts and alleviations? The affluent, I fear, do not consider
what a benefit-ticket has fallen to their lot out of millions
not so fortunate; yet less do they reflect that chance, not merit,
drew the prize out of the wheel.” Crabbe portrays this non-reflecting
complacency in one of his metrical tales:</p>

<p>Richard Savage, as Mr. Whitehead pictures him, bitterly
conversant with cold and hunger, a houseless vagrant through
the streets by night, and a famishing lounger in them by day,
apostrophises Mr. Overseer in his pursy prosperity, much as
(<i>mutatis mutandis</i>) Lear apostrophises pomp. “Turn out, fat
man of substance, and bob for wisdom and charity on the
banks of Southwark. They are best taken at night, when God
only sees you—when the east wind is abroad, making you
shake like the sinner who was hanged for breaking into your
dwelling-house. ‘The air bites shrewdly, it is very cold,’
sayest thou? It is so. But tell me whether, on the fourth
night, when thou liest stretched on thy blessed bed, thy heart
is not warmer than it was wont to be—whether thou dost not
pray prayers of long omission—whether thou wilt not, in the

abundance? Sayest thou, no? God help thee!” As Van

<p>Diderot rose one Shrove Tuesday morning, and groping in
his pocket, found nothing wherewith to dine that day—which
he spent in wandering about Paris and its precincts. He was
ill when he got back to his quarters, went to bed, and was
treated by his landlady to a little toast and wine. “That day,”
he often told a friend, in after life, “I swore that, if ever I
came to have anything, I would never in my life refuse a poor
man help, never condemn my fellow-creature to a day as
painful.” As the sailor says, after the wreck, in one of Mr.
Roscoe’s tragedies: “We may be wrecked a dozen times, for
what our betters care; but being aboard themselves, they see
some spice of danger in it, and that breeds a fellow-feeling.”
And, proverbially, a fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin demands whether, even supposing it guiltless,
luxury would be desired by any of us, if we saw clearly at
our sides the suffering which accompanies it in the world.
“Luxury is indeed possible in the future—innocent and exquisite;
luxury for all, and by the help of all; but luxury at
present can only be enjoyed by the ignorant; the cruelest man
living could not sit at his feast, unless he sat blindfold.”</p>

<p>Gibbon records to the honour of at least one Pontiff’s
temporal government of Rome, that he—Gregory the Great—relieved
by the bounty of each day, and of every hour, the
instant distress of the sick and needy—his treasurers being
continually summoned to satisfy, in his name, the requirements
of indigence and merit. “Nor would the pontiff indulge himself
in a frugal repast, till he had sent the dishes from his own
table to some objects deserving of his compassion.” A <i>non
possumus</i> this, in its beneficent <i>nisi prius</i> scope, more appreciable
by Protestants at least than that of some other Holy
Fathers. A sovran’s interest in the sufferings of his or her
subjects is always of exceptional interest in the eyes of fellow-subjects.

<p>Madame de Chevreuse, in a popular French romance, is
made to say to, and <i>at</i>, Anne of Austria, that kings are so far
removed from other people, from the “vulgar herd,” that they
forget that others ever stand in need of the bare necessaries of
life. She likens them to the dweller on African mountains,
who, gazing from the verdant table-land, refreshed by the
rills of melted snow, cannot comprehend that the dwellers
in the plains below him are perishing from hunger and thirst
in the midst of their lands, burnt up by the heat of the sun.
When, in the same romance—by courtesy historical; only the
proportion of history to romance in it is much about that of
Falstaff’s bread bill to his running account for sack—one
of Anne of Austria’s sons, the reigning king, young Lewis the
Fourteenth, is substituted in the Bastille for his ill-starred
brother, and so comes to taste of suffering <i>in propriâ
personâ</i>,—the royal prisoner tries to remember at what hour
the first repast is served to the captives in that fortress—but
his ignorance of this detail occasions a feeling of remorse
that smites him like the keen thrust of a dagger: “that he
should have lived for five and twenty years a king, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
enjoyment of every happiness, without having bestowed a
moment’s thought</p>

<p class="noindent">on the misery of those who had been unjustly deprived of
their liberty. The king blushed for very shame. He felt that
Heaven, in permitting this fearful humiliation, did no more
than render to the man the same torture as was inflicted
by that man upon so many others.”—It is in a glowing description
of one of the great fêtes at Versailles under the auspices
of this, the Grand Monarque, that M. Arsène Houssaye
delivers himself of this pensive aside: “Et la musique de
Lulli achève d’enivrer tout ce beau monde, qui ne pense pas
un seul instant que près de là, à la grille même du château des
merveilles, une pauvre femme prie et pleure, tout affamée, pour
ses enfants. Qu’importe! passe ton chemin, et reviens plus
tard. Comment t’appelles-tu, bonne femme?—Je m’appelle la
France: <i>je reviendrai</i>.”</p>

<p>Part of the education of the royal heir-apparent of the Incas
consisted in a course of gymnastic training, with competitive
trials of skill—during which, for a period of thirty days, “the
royal neophyte fared no better than his comrades, sleeping
on the bare ground, going unshod, and wearing a mean attire,—a
mode of life, it was supposed, which might tend to inspire
him with more sympathy with the destitute.” It is to royalty
that Jeanie Deans is pleading, when she exclaims, “Alas! it is
not when we sleep soft and wake merrily ourselves, that
we think on other people’s sufferings. Our hearts are waxed
light within us then.... But when the hour of trouble
comes—and seldom may it visit your leddyship—and when
the hour of death comes, that comes to high and low—lang and
late may it be yours—O my leddy, then it isna what we
hae dune for oursells, but what we hae dune for others, that
we think on maist pleasantly.” An English traveller in Russia,
discussing the difficulty with which news of starving peasants
reaches the ears of the czar, and tracing the roundabout track
by which, at last, when many have died, and many more
are dying, a stifled wail penetrates through the “official cotton-stuffed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
ears of district police auditoria, district chambers of
domains, military chiefs of governments, and imperial chancelleries
without number,” and comes soughing into the private
cabinet of the czar at the Winter Palace or Peterhoff,—goes
on to say: “The empress, good soul, sheds tears when
she hears of the dreadful sufferings of the poor people so
many hundred versts off. The imperial children, I have
no doubt, wonder why, if the peasants have no bread to
eat, they don’t take to plum-cake; the Emperor is affected,
but goes to work,” etc. Which last expression, by the way,
reminds us of a <i>quasi</i> quotation by Mr. Carlyle of Shakespeare’s
text in juxtaposition with mention of the greatest of czars:
“Descend, O Donothing Pomp; quit thy down-cushions;
expose thyself to learn what wretches feel, and how to cure it!
The czar of Russia became a dusty toiling shipwright; ...
and his aim was small to thine.” There was a miserable
day in the Highland wanderings of Prince Charles when,
with Ned Burke and Donald Macleod for companions, after
roving about all night, excessively faint for want of food,
he was obliged to subsist on meal stirred in brine—there
being no fresh water within reach. The prince is said to
have expressed himself thankful for even this nauseous food—“salt-water
drammock”—and to have declared, on the
occasion, that if ever he mounted a throne, he should not
fail to remember “those who dined with him to-day.” When
Flora Macdonald and Lady Clanranald, not long afterwards,
came to the royal outcast,—on entering the hut they found
him engaged in roasting the heart and liver of a sheep on
a wooden spit; a sight at which some of the party could
not help shedding tears. “Charles, always the least concerned
at his distressing circumstances, though never forgetting
the hopes inspired by his birth, jocularly observed that it
would be well perhaps for all kings if they had to come through
such a fiery ordeal as he was enduring.” At a subsequent
period we find him living for days together on a few
handfuls of oatmeal and about a pound of butter—referring to
which he afterwards told a Highland gentleman that he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
come to know what a quarter of a peck of meal was, having
once subsisted on such a quantity for the better part of a week.
Another time we find him spending the night in an open cave,
on the top of a high hill between the Braes of Glenmorriston
and Strathglass,—a cave too narrow to let him stretch himself,
and in which he lay drenched to the skin, with no possibility
of getting a fire to dry him. “Without food, and deprived of
sleep by the narrowness and hardness of his bed, the only
comfort he could obtain was the miserable one of smoking
a pipe.” Hardly was Lear himself more thoroughly exposed
to feel what wretches feel, on that night beside the hovel on
the heath.</p>

<p>In that paradoxical essay of his, on saying grace before
meat, Charles Lamb remarks that the indigent man, who hardly
knows whether he shall have a meal the next day or not, sits
down to his fare with a present sense of the blessing, which can
be but feebly acted by the rich, into whose minds the conception
of wanting a dinner could never, but by some extreme
theory, have entered. According to the essayist, the heats
of epicurism put out the gentle flame of devotion: the incense
which rises round is pagan, and the belly-god intercepts it for
his own. “The very excess of the provision beyond the needs,
takes away all sense of proportion between the end and means.
The Giver is veiled by his gifts. You are startled at the injustice
of returning thanks—for what?—for having so much, while so
many starve. It is to praise the gods amiss.”</p>

<p>Taking for his text the apprenticeship of good Abbot Samson
at St. Edmund’s shrine, Mr. Carlyle moralises on how
much would many a Serene Highness have learnt, had he
travelled through the world with water-jug and empty wallet,
<i>sine omni expensâ</i>, and returned only to sit down at the foot of
St. Edmund’s shrine to shackles and bread and water. Patriotism
itself, a political economist has remarked, can never be
generated by a passive enjoyment of good; the evil tendency
of which he bids us see by merely looking to a city like London;
where the rich who live together in streets of fine houses
many miles long, and have every comfort provided for them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
without their interference, and need nothing from the poor but
what they buy for money, and conclude that the same State
which cares for them will care equally for the poor,—such rich
men, it is alleged, have every inducement to become isolated
from all but the few with whom it is pleasant to live. We may
choose, says Professor Kingsley, to look at the masses in the
gross as subjects for statistics—and of course, where possible,
for profits. “There is One above who knows every thirst,
and ache, and sorrow, and temptation of each slattern, and
gin-drinker, and street boy. The day will come when He will
require an account of these neglects of ours—not in the gross.”
Mrs. Gaskell ably describes the fear of Margaret Hale, in
“North and South,” lest, in her West-end ease, she should
become sleepily deadened into forgetfulness of anything beyond
the life that was lapping her round with luxury. “There
might be toilers and moilers there in London, but she never
saw them; the very servants lived in an underground world of
their own, of which she knew neither the hopes nor the fears;
they only seemed to start into existence when some want or
whim of their master and mistress needed them.” Mr. Thackeray
presents Ethel Newcome in the fairest light when he shows
her studious to become acquainted with her indigent neighbours—giving
much time to them and thought; visiting from
house to house without ostentation; awe-stricken by that
spectacle of poverty which we have with us always, of which
the sight rebukes our selfish griefs into silence, the thought
compels us to charity, humility, and devotion. “Death never
dying out; hunger always crying; and children born to it day
after day,—our young London lady, flying from the splendours
and follies in which her life had been passed, found herself in
the presence of these; threading darkling alleys which swarmed
with wretched life; sitting by naked beds, whither by God’s
blessing she was sometimes enabled to carry a little comfort and
consolation; or whence she came heart-stricken by the overpowering
misery, or touched by the patient resignation, of the
new friends to whom fate had directed her.” No longer <i>ignara
mali, miseris succurrere discit</i>. An essayist of Mr. Thackeray’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
school, on the topic of parliamentary trains, breaks out, or off,
into the apostrophe: “Ah, judges of Amontillado sherry;
crushers of walnuts with silver crackers; connoisseurs who
prefer French to Spanish olives, and are curious about the yellow
seal; gay riders in padded chariots; proud cavaliers of blood-horses,—you
don’t know how painfully and slowly, almost agonisingly,
the poor have to scrape and save, and deny themselves
the necessaries of life, to gather together the penny-a-mile fare.”
Lord Jeffrey eagerly asserted the even painful interest with which
one of Mr. Dickens’s Christmas books affected him: “sanative,
I dare say, to the spirit, but making us despise and loathe ourselves
for passing our days in luxury, while better and gentler
creatures are living such lives as make us wonder that such
things can be in a society of human beings, or even in the
world of a good God.” Lord Lytton has compared the stray
glimpses one gets of want and misery, to looking through a
solar microscope at the monsters in a drop of water, when the
gazer wonders how things so terrible have hitherto been unknown
to him: “Lapped in your sleek comforts, and lolling
on the sofa of your patent conscience ... you are startled
and dismayed” at the sight: you say within yourself, “Can
such things be? I never dreamed of this before! I thought
what was invisible to me was non-existent in itself—I will
remember this dread experiment.” The like is the moral of
Hood’s poem of the Lady’s Dream. From grief exempt, she
had never dreamt of such a world of woe as appals her in
apocalyptic visions of the night; never dreamt till now of the
hearts that daily break, and the tears that hourly fall, and the
many, many troubles of life that grieve this earthly ball—disease,
and hunger, and pain, and want; but now she dreams
of them all—of the naked she might have clad, the famished
she might have fed, the sorrowing she might have solaced; of
each pleading that, long ago, she scanned with a heedless eye.</p>

<p>An <i>Edinburgh</i> Reviewer of mortality in trades and professions,
dwelling on the fatal conditions under which very many
classes earn their daily bread, and sometimes not so much as
that,—observes that the great middle and upper classes,
accustomed to be furnished with all the appliances of easy life
and luxury, seldom give a thought as to the manner in which
their wants are supplied. “Accustomed to sip the honey, it
never strikes us that perhaps its product involves in some cases
the life of the working-bee. The lady, who, from the silken
ease of her fauteuil, surveys her drawing-room, may learn a
lesson of compassion for the poor workmen in nearly every
article that lies before her.” To take one example out of the
many upon which Dr. Wynter dilates—the case of the silverer
of looking-glasses: “If the charming belle, as she surveys her
beauty in the glass, could but for a moment see reflected this
poor shattered human creature, with trembling muscles, brown
visage, and blackened teeth, she would doubtless start with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
horror; but, as it is, the slaves of luxury and vanity drop out
of life unobserved and uncared for, as the stream of travellers
disappeared one by one through the bridge of Mirza.”</p>

<p>The moral of the eastern tale of Nourjahad is practical and
pertinent. He delivers himself up to luxury and riot. He
forgets that there are wants and distresses among his fellow-creatures.
He lives only for himself, and his heart becomes as
hard as the coffers which hold his misapplied treasures. But
before it is too late he is awakened to remorse, and looks back
with shame and horror on his past life. What shall he do to
expiate his offences? One thing at least is within his power,
and that will he do at once: expend his riches in the relief of
want—nor rest until he has found out every family in Ormuz
whom calamity has overtaken, that he may restore them to
prosperity. Henceforth he spends his days in his closet,
laying plans for the benefit of his fellow-creatures. Ben Jonson’s
Sordido promises the like amendment:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WIND_EARTHQUAKE_FIRE_AND_STILL_SMALL_VOICE"><i>WIND, EARTHQUAKE, FIRE, AND STILL SMALL VOICE.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">1 Kings</span> xix. 11, 12.</p>

</div>

<p>While Elijah stood upon the mount before the Lord,
there arose a great and strong wind that rent the
mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks; but the Lord was
not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but
the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake
a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire
a still small voice. We are not told that the Lord was not in
the still small voice. We find that He was. And with that
voice He addressed Elijah, reasoned with him, admonished,
sustained, and directed him. May it not be said, in applying
and adapting the narrative, which things are an allegory? The
import of the narrative sublimely anticipates the homely fable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of sun and wind. Wind, earthquake, and fire, are mighty
agents; but they may pass by without tangible result as
regards real influence on the spirit of man; whereas the gentle
influence of a still small voice speaks home to it at once, and it
responds to the strain, and is subdued by the spell.</p>

<p>The drift of the present annotations, in their applied sense,
finds expression in Ben Jonson’s reminder:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">“There is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A way of working more by love than fear:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fear works on servile natures, not the free.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Landor’s Parable of Asabel, the angel’s gentleness
wrought upon that turbulent, refractory spirit, “even as the
quiet and silent water wins itself an entrance where tempest
and fire pass over.” It is written that other angels did look
up with loving and admiration into the visage of this angel on
his return; and he told the younger and more zealous of them,
that whenever they would descend into the gloomy vortex of
the human heart, under the softness and serenity of their voice
and countenance its turbulence would subside.</p>

<p>Plutarch tells us of Fabius Maximus, that he thought it
hard that, while those who breed dogs and horses soften their
stubborn tempers, and bring down their fierce spirits by care
and kindness, rather than with whips and chains, he who
has the command of men should not endeavour to correct
their errors by gentleness and goodness, but treat them in even
a harsher and more violent manner than gardeners do the wild
fig-trees, pears, and olives, whose nature they subdue by
cultivation, and which by that means they bring to produce
very agreeable fruit.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>We read of the distinguished Spanish author and statesman,
Fermin Caballero, that while under the care of a kind and
judicious instructor, he, as a boy, made rapid advance in
the study of classical literature; but that on being removed
from this tutor, and subjected to harsh and grinding discipline,
he lapsed into idleness and obstinacy beyond all control.
Not the least wise of the maxims to be culled from the pages of
Terence is that in which <i>satius esse credit Pudore et liberalitate
liberos retinere, quam metu</i>. Southey insists that no man was
ever more thoroughly ignorant of the nature of children than
John Wesley, as when he enjoins: “Let a child from a year
old be taught to fear the rod, and to cry softly; from that age
make him do as he is bid, if you whip him ten times running
to effect it.” If Wesley had been a father himself, urges
that tenderest of fathers, Robert the Rhymer, “he would have
known that children are more easily governed by love than
by fear.” And as with children, so with men, who are but
children of a larger growth; and especially so with women, if
we may take the word of one of Shakspeare’s most winsome
women for it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">“You may ride us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs, ere</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With spur we heat an acre.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">So with Landor’s Filippa, on whom harsh treatment and compulsory
measures are simply thrown away:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rudeness can neither move nor discompose her:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A word, a look, of kindness, instantly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opens her heart and brings her cheek upon you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And as with men and women, so with peoples, who are made
up of men and women. And yet, although, as the author of
the “Wealth of Nations” expresses it, management and persuasion
are always the easiest and safest instruments of
government, as force and violence are the worst and most
dangerous; such, it seems, is the natural insolence of man,
that he almost always disdains to use the good instrument,
except when he cannot or dare not use the bad one. Not that
nations are without diversities of character, and so of susceptibility
to diverse modes of government. Gibbon apologises, as
it were, for Diocletian’s utter destruction of those proud cities,
Busiris and Coptos, and for his severe treatment of Egypt
in general, by the remark, that the character of the Egyptian
nation, insensible to kindness, but extremely susceptible to
fear, could alone justify this excessive rigour. The tone is that
of the courtier Crispe, to Phocas, in Corneille’s “Heraclius:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Il faut agir de force avec de tels esprits ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">La violence est juste où la douceur est vaine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Coke maintains that if they are the best whom love induces,
they are the most whom fear restrains: <i>Si meliores sunt
quos ducit amor, plures sunt quos corrigit timor</i>. La Fontaine’s
fable of the fishes and the flute-playing shepherd, intimates the
sheer futility of wasting sweet sounds on ears not to be so
caught. There are men, sententiously quoth Dr. Tempest, in
the “Last Chronicle of Barset,” who are deaf as adders to
courtesy, but who are compelled to obedience at once by
ill-usage.</p>

<p>Educationists must provide for the contingency of having to
deal with abnormal natures of this crabbed and distorted kind.
But as exceptions only. The Jesuits are confessedly masters of
the arts of education; and the rule of the Jesuits is to lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
not to drive, their pupils; to allure and win, not to coerce and
constrain them. Winsome womankind is mistress of the like
arts. Those of the sex who <i>are</i> winsome, it has been said,
with their plastic manners and non-aggressive force, always
have their own way in the end. “They coax and flatter
for their rights, and consequently they are given privileges
in excess of their rights; whereas the women who take their
rights, as things to which they are entitled without favour, lose
them and their privileges together.” Kitely’s advice is good,
in “Every Man in his Humour,” and of general application:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But rather use the soft persuading way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose powers will work more gently, and compose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The imperfect thoughts you labour to reclaim;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More winning, than enforcing the consent.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first bishop sent from Iona for the Northumbrian
Church was Corman, a man described by Dean Milman as of
austere and inflexible character, who, finding more resistance
than he expected to his doctrines, in a full assembly of the
nation sternly reproached the Northumbrians for their obstinacy,
and declared that he would no longer waste his
labours on so irreclaimable a race. A gentle voice was heard:
“Brother, have you not been too harsh with your unlearned
hearers? Should you not, like the apostles, have fed them
with the milk of Christian doctrine, till they could receive the
full feast of our sublimer truths?” All eyes, it is added, were
turned on Aidan, a humble but devout monk; and by general
acclamation that discreet and gentle teacher was saluted as
bishop. The same historian describes Aldhelm of Malmesbury,
in minstrel’s garb, arresting the careless crowd of church-goers
on a bridge they must pass, and having fully enthralled
their attention by the sweetness of his song, anon introducing
into it some of the solemn truths of religion; thus succeeding
in winning to the faith many hearts, which he would have
attempted in vain to move by severer language, or even by the
awful excommunication of the Church.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> When Fénélon was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
intrusted by Lewis the Fourteenth with a mission to Poitou, to
convert the Protestants, he refused the aid of dragoons, and
resorted to suavity of persuasion alone as an instrument of
conversion. Of the Protestant missions in the west of Ireland,
complaint has been made of their being conducted too offensively,
like raids upon heathendom: the Romanist, who might
possibly open his bosom to the warm rays of charity, only
folds the cloak of his hereditary faith more closely round him,
when assailed by the bitter wind of a propagandism which
seeks its way to the heart by violence and insult.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It is at once, on the one part pleasant, on the other
painful, to find the Lord Treasurer Burleigh, who had ever
been the fast friend of Whitgift, frequently expressing his disapprobation
of the primate’s severity against non-conformists,
and his wish “that the spirit of gentleness might win, rather
than severity.” And being here on Elizabethan ground, let us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
note Mr. Froude’s reference to the diverse procedure of Cecil
and Throgmorton in their several dealings with the queen,—she
being one of the many strong-willed people, on whom
menaces and reproaches operate only as a spur. Cecil understood
best Elizabeth’s disposition. “By ‘practices,’ by ‘bye-ways,’
as he afterwards described it, by affecting to humour
what he was passionately anxious to prevent, he was holding
his mistress under delicate control; and he dreaded lest his
light leading-strings should be broken by a ruder touch.” As
with the queen, so with her people. When Catherine de
Medici expressed astonishment to Sir Thomas Smith, at a
certain deference paid by his sovereign to the nation she ruled,
“Madam,” he replied, “her people be not like your people;
they must be trained by <i>douceur</i> and persuasion, not by rigour
and violence.” The greatest of Russian empresses emulated
in this respect the greatest of English queens. Indeed, her
tendency to indulgence was imputed to Catharine II. as a fault,
advantage being taken of her constant reluctance to punish.
But how far greater things did she, on the whole, achieve
with her subjects, exclaims Mr. Herman Merivale, “thus
gently led, than those of her predecessors and successors who
employed on them in such abundance the more forcible
methods of government!”</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman, in the course of showing that Harold’s way
of bringing in the proud Danes of the North to his obedience
was not exactly the same as William’s way, describes him
as determining, with that noble and generous daring which is
sometimes the highest prudence, to trust himself in the hands
of the people who refused to acknowledge him. “These his
enemies, who would not that he should reign over them, instead
of being brought and slain before him, were to be won
over by the magic of his personal presence in their own land.”
To apply what the Gaulish ambassador says of a great Roman
in Jonson’s tragedy,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This magistrate hath struck an awe into me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by his sweetness won a more regard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unto his place, than all the boisterous moods</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">That ignorant greatness practiseth, to fill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The large, unfit authority it wears.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Antwerp authorities had reason and experience on their
side when they sought to persuade the Prince of Parma, in
1585, that the hearts of, not the Antwerpers only, but of the
Hollanders and Zealanders, were easily to be won at that
moment: give them religious liberty, and “govern them by gentleness
rather than by Spanish grandees,” and a reconciliation
would speedily be ensured. Two years later, but then two
years too late, we find the prince averring that he liked “to
proceed rather by the ways of love than of rigour and effusion
of blood.” This was in answer to Queen Elizabeth, who, at a
previous juncture, angrily derided any “slight and mild kind of
dealing with a people so ingrate,” and was all for corrosives
instead of lenitives for such festering wounds. Rulers, who fail
to secure what they wish by gentle means, are apt very soon to
resort to the less excellent way; like Chilperic, the “Nero of
France,” coaxing the Jew Priscus to turn Christian; first employing
argument, then trying blandishments, and anon taking
to more powerful reasoning by throwing the Jew into prison.
Tytler remarks of the “violent instructions” enforced by Henry
VIII. on his envoy to James V., that had the overbearing
Tudor adopted a suaver tone, a favourable impression might
have been made; but the King o’ Scots was “not to be
threatened into a compliance with a line of policy which, if
suggested in a tone of conciliation, his judgment might have
approved,” and his unwounded sense of self-respect have
consented to carry into effect.</p>

<p>Simon the glover, in Scott’s story of mediæval Perth, is well
described as watchful over the tactics his daughter employs
towards Henry Smith, “whom he knew to be as ductile, when
influenced by his affections, as he was fierce and intractable
when assailed by hostile remonstrances or threats.” <i>Par
un chemin plus doux</i>, says a shrewd counsellor in Racine,
<i>vous pourrez le ramener</i>; whereas <i>les menaces le rendront plus
farouche</i>. Archbishop Whately deprecates the bullying and
browbeating system in vogue with certain barristers, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
declares it to be a mistake as a means of eliciting truth: he
cites his own observation of the marked success of the opposite
mode of questioning, and maintains that, generally speaking, a
quiet, gentle, and straightforward examination will be the most
adapted to elicit truth; the browbeating and blustering which
are likeliest to confuse an honest, simple-minded witness, being
just what the dishonest one is the best prepared for. “The
more the storm blusters, the more carefully he wraps round
him the cloak which a warm sunshine will often induce him to
throw off.”</p>

<p>We are told of Dr. Beattie, in his relations as a professor
with his class, that his sway was absolute, because it was
founded in reason and affection; that he never employed a
harsh epithet in finding fault with any of his pupils; and that
when, instead of a rebuke, which they were conscious they
deserved, they met merely with a mild reproof, it was conveyed
in such a manner as to throw, not only the delinquent, but
sometimes the whole class into tears. Fielding’s boy-hero is at
once in tears when the kind squire takes him in hand, instead
of the harsh tutor; his “guilt now flew in his face more than
any severity could make it. He could more easily bear the
lashes of Thwackum than the generosity of Allworthy.” Mrs.
Fry used to bear eager record of the docility she had found,
and the gratitude she had experienced, from female prisoners,
though the most abandoned of their sex: kind treatment, even
with restraint obviously for their good, was so new to them,
that it called forth, as Sir Samuel Romilly says, “even in the
most depraved, grateful and generous feelings.” True to the
life is the picture Mr. Reade has drawn of the effect on the
actress, of a young wife coming to her as a supplicant, instead
of inveighing against her,—coming with faith in her goodness,
and sobbing to her for pity: “a big tear rolled down her
cheek, and proved her something more than an actress.” In
another of his books he illustrates the truth that men can
resist the remonstrances that wound them, and so irritate
them, better than they can those gentle appeals which rouse no
anger, but soften the whole heart. “The old people stung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
him; but Mercy, without design, took a surer way. She never
said a word; but sometimes, when the discussions were at
their height, she turned her dove-like eyes on him, with a look
so loving, so humbly inquiring, so timidly imploring, that his
heart melted within him.” So with Janet Dempster, in George
Eliot’s story of clerical life, who “was not to be made meek by
cruelty; she would repent of nothing in the face of injustice,
though she was subdued in a moment by a word or a look that
recalled the old days of fondness.” In fine, we may conclude
with the conclusion of old Master Knowell, in the Elizabethan
play:</p>

of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy, had gone one
step too far in his enmity to the Jews, and had let his vaulting
ambition overleap itself in his insolent confidence in royal
favour,—Harbonah it was that prompted royal vengeance with
the suggestive reminder,—“Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits
high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken
good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.” Then
the king said—catching at once at the chamberlain’s suggestion—“Hang
him thereon.” “So they hanged Haman on the
gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.”</p>

<p>Somewhat musty is the adage that no law is more equitable
than that by which the deviser of death perishes by his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
device: <i>nec lex est æquior ulla, quam necis artificem arte perire
suâ</i>. Musty it might be even in Harbonah’s days; but the
chamberlain, in the excitement of so signal an example, would
feel that time cannot stale, nor custom wither, the force and
import of that retributive law.</p>

<p>Mr. de Quincey, in his memorable narrative of the revolt of
the Tartars, or flight of the Kalmuck Khan and his people
from the Russian territories to the frontiers of China (1771),
relates in conclusion how Zebek-Dorchi, the author and
originator of this great Tartar <i>exodus</i>, perished after a manner
specially gratifying to those who compassed his ruin; the
Chinese morality being exactly of that kind which approves in
everything the <i>lex talionis</i>. “Finally, Zebek-Dorchi was invited
to the imperial lodge, together with all his accomplices;
and under the skilful management of the Chinese nobles in the
emperor’s establishment, the murderous artifices of these Tartar
chieftains were made to recoil upon themselves, and the whole
of them perished by assassination at a great imperial banquet.”
Iterated and reiterated in holy writ is the retributive law that
the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness; that transgressors
shall be taken in their own naughtiness; that he that seeketh
mischief it shall come unto him. The presidents and princes
under King Darius, who sought occasion against Daniel, and
persuaded their reluctant sovereign to cast the prophet into the
den of lions, who however wrought him no manner of hurt,—upon
<i>them</i> the <i>lex talionis</i> vindicated its literal severity when
they in their turn were cast into the lions’ den, and the lions
had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or
ever they came at the bottom of the den.</p>

<p>The early ballads of almost every literature delight in these
retributive surprises. Genuine was the zest of our fathers for
such a retort as that of William of Cloudesly on the Justice
who is having him measured for his grave:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I have seen as great a marvel,’ said Cloudesly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘As between this and prime</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Himself may lie therein.’”</div>

<p>So fond is popular history of teaching this sort of philosophy
by examples, that examples to the purpose are widely accepted
which are yet not historical. Cardinal Balue, under Louis XI.,
is pointed out in his iron cage, as a malignant inventor punished
in and through his own invention; but Michelet has exposed
the fallacy of supposing Balue the inventor of those iron cages
which had long been known in Italy. Still he had the “merit”
of being their importer into France; and the <i>lex talionis</i> has its
application to him. One remembers of course the Regent
Morton hugged to death by the “maiden” he had been the
means of introducing into Scotland. The French doctor,
Guillotin, is even now not uncommonly believed to have
perished in the reign of terror by the instrument invented by
and named after him; whereas he quietly died in his bed,
many, many years later than that. But the Revolution history
is well stored with instances like that of Châlier, condemned to
death by the criminal tribunal at Lyons,—the guillotine, which
he had sent for from Paris to destroy his enemies, being first
destined to sever his own head from his body. A bungling
executioner prolonged the last agonies of this man, who in fact
was hacked to death, not decapitated. He tasted slowly, as
Lamartine says, of the death, a thirst for which he had so
often sought to excite in the people; “he was glutted with
blood, but it was his own.” Alison recognises in the death of
Murat a memorable instance of the moral retribution which
often attends upon “great deeds of iniquity, and by the instrumentality
of the very acts which appeared to place them beyond
its reach.” He underwent in 1815 the very fate to which,
seven years before, he had consigned a hundred Spaniards
at Madrid, guilty of no other crime than that of defending their
country; and this, as Sir Archibald adds, “by the application
of a law to his own case, which he himself had introduced, to
check the attempts of the Bourbons to regain a throne which
he had usurped.” No man, Lord Macaulay affirms, ever made
a more unscrupulous use of the legislative power for the
destruction of his enemies than Thomas Cromwell; and it was
by an unscrupulous use of the legislative power that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
himself destroyed. Those who tauntingly reminded Fenwick,
when attainted in 1696, that he had supported the bill which
attainted Monmouth, were warned that they might perhaps
themselves be tauntingly reminded in some dark and terrible
hour, that they had supported the bill which attainted Fenwick.
“God forbid that our tyrants should ever be able to plead, in
justification of the worst that they can inflict upon us, precedents
furnished by ourselves!” Again, it is in recording
how, late in life, a horrible calumny settled upon Cicero, that
Mr. de Quincey, without lending a moment’s credit to the foul
insinuation, nevertheless is free to recognise the equity of this
retribution revolving upon one who, he asserts, had so often
slandered others in the same malicious way. “At last the
poisoned chalice came round to his own lips, and at a moment
when it wounded the most acutely.” <i>Sæpe</i>, as Seneca has it,
<i>in magistrum scelera redierunt sua</i>.</p>

<p>Plutarch rejoices in showing in Hercules an avenger who
adapted the special mode of vengeance to the distinctive
deserts of the wrong-doer. He punished with the very mode
of punishment devised by those who were now made to suffer
it. Antæus he killed in wrestling, and Termerus by breaking
his skull,—it being the <i>specialité</i> of Termerus to destroy the
passengers he met by dashing his head against theirs. Theseus
was the imitator of Hercules in this retributive system; he
punished Sinis, a bandit,—who used to kill travellers by
binding them to the boughs of two pine-trees, which were then
allowed to swing back and separate—by making an end of him
in the self-same way; Procrustes again he stretched on his own
bed. Phalaris, the tyrant of Agrigentum, infamous for his
cruelty, and specially for the device devised for him by Perillus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
of a brazen bull in which he burnt his victims—this Phalaris
first tried the device on this Perillus; and when Phalaris was
deposed an indignant mob practised upon <i>him</i> the self-same
torture to which he had subjected so many. And ever memorable
among other tales of antiquity,—old wives’ fables if you
will, but then have not all fables a moral?—is that of Diomedes,
who was devoured by the horses he had himself taught to feed
on the flesh and blood of men. “Ashes always fly back in the
face of him that throws them,” is a proverb in the Yoruba
language, quoted by Archbishop Trench as equivalent to our
“Harm watch, harm catch,” and perhaps to the Spanish,
“He that sows thorns, let him not walk barefoot.” An overruling
Power disposes of what the malignity of man proposes,

<p>The psalmist felt that he was praying in accordance with the
Divine will, when he prayed that the ungodly might fall into
their own nets together, while he ever escaped them. So again
with his prayer that the mischief of their own lips might fall
upon the heads of them that compassed him about. For it
was a matter at once of faith and of experience with the
psalmist, that the evil deviser and evil-doer, travailing with
mischief, conceiving sorrow, and bringing forth ungodliness,
who had graven and digged up a pit, was apt to fall himself into
the destruction that he made for other. “For his travail shall
come upon his own head, and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.” Owen Feltham delights to recall, from the stores of
ancient and mediæval story, how Bagoas, a Persian nobleman,
having poisoned Artaxerxes and Artamenes, was detected by
Darius, and forced to drink poison himself; how Diomedes, as
we have already seen, for the beasts he had fed on human flesh
was by Hercules made food; and how Pope Alexander VI.,
having designed the poisoning of his friend Cardinal Adrian,
by his cup-bearer’s mistake of the bottle, took the draught
himself, “and so died by the same engine which he himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
had appointed to kill another”—a sort of enginery glanced at
in Ben Jonson:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">too clever by half. Luther, in his Table-talk, welcomes the
import of the Jewish story of Og, king of Bashan, who they say
had lifted a great rock to throw at his enemies, “but God made
a hole in the middle, so that it slipped down upon the giant’s
neck, and he could never rid himself of it.” The fourth book
of Southey’s “Thalaba” closes with a shriek from Lobaba the
sorcerer, which this final stanza sufficiently explains:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nor, among the lyrical pieces of the same poet, be forgotten
that ballad of the Inchcape rock, which tells how the bell put
up by the abbot of Aberbrothok to warn ships of their peril,
was taken down by a sea pirate, Sir Ralph the Rover, who in
the words of an old Scottish topographer, “a yeare thereafter
perished upon the same rocke, with ship and goodes, in the
righteous judgment of God.” Many and many</p>

<p>Prescott’s narrative of the decline and fall of Luna, minister
under John II. of Castile, is pointed with this moral to adorn
the tale; that “by one of those dispensations of Providence

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> vi. 34.</p>

</div>

<p>With a divine calm fall those words from the Sermon
of the Mount—spoken as never man spake—which
bid us take “no thought for the morrow; for the morrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof.”</p>

<p>Pagan philosophy had, and natural theism has, its approximation
to the same point of view. Horace is all for letting the
mind enjoy the enjoyable present, and for leaving no room or
resting-place for the sole of the foot of Black Care, raven and
unclean bird that she is. The morrow may be hers, but to-day
at least is his, and the morrow shall take care for the things
of itself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lætus in præsens animus quod ultra est</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oderit curare.”</div>

</div>

<p>David Hume, again, meets the doctrine that we should
always have before our eyes, death, disease, poverty, blindness,
calumny, and the like, as ills which are incident to human
nature, and which may befall us to-morrow,—by the answer,
that if we confine ourselves to a general and distant reflection
on the ills of human life, such a vague procedure can have no
effect to prepare us for them; and that if, on the other hand,
by close and intense meditation we render them present and
intimate to us, we realise the true secret for poisoning all our
pleasures, and rendering us perpetually miserable. He grieves
more than need be, who begins to grieve before he need, is one
of Seneca’s sententious sayings: <i>Plus dolet quam necesse est, qui
ante dolet quam necesse est</i>. One of Mrs. Gore’s women of the
world—who might probably be counted by the hundred—is
sprightly and smart in her rebuke of her husband and his
sister for their delight in perplexing the brightest moments of
existence by all the agonies of second sight, and whom she
represents as quite indignant when they find her sympathy
waiting the actual occurrence of evil. “I hate,” she says, “to
turn back my head towards the dark shadow that follows me,
or direct my telescope towards a coming storm.” And herein
was she wise, if not with all the wisdom of those Christian
morals, of which we have so impressive an expositor in Sir
Thomas Browne. “Leave future occurrences to their uncertainties,”
writes the fine old physician, Religiosus Medicus,
“think that which is present thy own; and, since ’tis easier to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
foretell an eclipse than a foul day at some distance, look for little
regular below. Attend with patience the uncertainty of things,
and what lieth yet unexerted in the chaos of futurity.” Shakspeare’s
noble Roman, at the dawn of the day of battle on which
so much depends, is natural man enough to utter the aspiration:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">“O, that a man might know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The end of this day’s business, ere it come!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But he is also stoic philosopher enough to check that prospective
yearning, with the reflection,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But it sufficeth that the day will end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then the end is known.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Swift opens his Birthday Address to Stella with the assurance,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This day, whate’er the fates decree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall still be kept with joy by me:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day, then, let us not be told,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you are sick and I grown old;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor think on our approaching ills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And talk of spectacles and pills;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To-morrow will be time enough</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To hear such mortifying stuff.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For once, however, it is only in the opening verses that the
dean is jocose; and he soon turns aside from his strain of levity
to bid Stella accept some serious lines “from not the gravest of
divines.” Schleiermacher, in one of his rather gushing letters,—for
he, too, though nothing of a Swift, and though of real
weight in divinity, was not in all senses the gravest of divines,—implores
his “dearest Jette” not to look so much into the
future. He cannot beg this too earnestly and too often, he says,—so
depressed is Jette apt to be by anticipation of things to
come, and from a perverse habit of condensing advent difficulties.
“It is easy to see through <i>one</i> pane of glass, but through
ten placed one upon another we cannot see. Does this prove
that each one is not transparent? or are we ever called upon to
look through more than one at a time? Double panes we only
have recourse to for warmth; and just so it is with life. We
have but to live <i>one</i> moment at a time. Keep each one isolated,
and you will easily see your way through them.” So again
writes good Frederick Perthes to his wife, whose fearful and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
hopeful longings, he tells her, are indeed guarantees for the
great future beyond the grave, but whom he urges to bear in
mind that a vigorous grasp of the present is our duty so long as
we are upon earth. It is the present moment, he reminds her,
that supplies the energy and decision that fit us for life; retrospect
brings sadness, and the dark future excites fears, so that
we should be crippled in our exertions were we not to lay a
vigorous grasp upon the present. And</p>

<p>There is never, observes Madame d’Arblay, in her diary, such

philosophy which belongs to making the most of the present
day, grows upon me strongly; and, as I have suffered infinitely

<p>Prevision and imagination, as Rousseau says, multiply the
evils of our lot: “<i>Pour moi</i>,” he professes—however the profession
may have squared with the practice—“<i>j’ai beau savoir
que je soufrirai demain, il me suffit de ne pas souffrir aujourd’hui
pour être tranquille</i>.” It is certainly a frenzy, quoth old
Montaigne, to go now and whip yourself, because it may so fall
out that fortune may one day decree you a whipping, and to
put on your furred gown at Midsummer, because you will stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
in need of it at Christmas. It was one of Madame de Sévigné’s
maxims in life to “regarder l’avenir comme une obscurité, dont
il peut arriver des biens et des clartés à quoi l’on ne s’attend
pas.” Milton’s Adam laments the mournful privilege of
“visions ill foreseen.” Better had he lived ignorant of future!
so had borne his part of evil only, each day’s lot enough to
bear. So again, in Milton’s Masque, the elder brother bids the
younger be not over-exquisite to cast the fashion of uncertain
evils:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For grant they be so, while they rest unknown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What need a man forestall his date of grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And run to meet what he would most avoid?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And once more, Milton himself, in one of those Sonnets
which stand in the like relation of merit to his great epic that
Shakspeare’s do to his great dramas, admonishes his scholar,
Cyriack Skinner, that heaven disproves the care,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">“though wise in show,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That with superfluous burden loads the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Melancholy commonly flies to the future for its aliment,”
says Sydney Smith, “and it must be encountered,” he adds,
“by diminishing the range of our views.” The great remedy
for melancholy, he insists in another place, is to “take short
views of life.” Are you happy now? Then why destroy present
happiness by a distant misery, which may never come at all?
For “every substantial grief has twenty shadows, and most of
them shadows of your own making.” One of his correspondents
he emphatically counsels to dispel that prophetic gloom which
dives into futurity, to extract sorrow from days and years to
come, and which considers its own unhappy visions as the decrees
of Providence. “We know nothing of to-morrow, our
business is to be good and happy to day.” In effect, like
Maucroix,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Il rit de ces prudents qui, par trop de sagesse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">S’en vont dans l’avenir chercher de la tristesse</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Et des soucis cuisants.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Once and again in his autobiography does the most influential,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
perhaps, of French philosophers avow his resolve <i>á vivre
désormais au jour la journée</i>, to take short views of life, and
regard distant objects as at once illusive and elusory. “Usons
de chaque jour sans trop de prévoyance du lendemain,” says
another. And it was an old French poet, fourscore and upwards,
who in 1700 wrote the four verses which since then have
been often cited:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Chaque jour est un bien que du ciel je reçois,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Je jouis aujourd’hui de celui qu’il me donne;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Il n’appartient pas plus aux jeunes gens qu’a moi,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Et celui de demain n’appartient a personne.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Boyd recognises as sound philosophy in Sydney Smith,
the advising us, whether physically or morally, to “take short
views.” One of his illustrations to the purpose is, that it would
knock you up at once if, when the railway carriage moved out
of the station at Edinburgh, you began to trace in your mind’s
eye the whole route to London. Never do that, he says; think
first of Dunbar, then of Newcastle, then of York, and, putting
the thing thus, you will get over the distance without fatigue of
mind. What little child, he asks, would have heart to begin
the alphabet, if, before he did so, you put clearly before him all
the school and college work of which it is the beginning? “The
poor little thing would knock up at once, wearied out by your
want of skill in putting things. And so it is that Providence,
kindly and gradually putting things, whiles us onward, still
keeping hope and heart, through the trials and cares of life.”
Every dog has its day, quaintly observes A. H. K. B. on another
occasion; but the day of the rational dog is overclouded in a
fashion unknown to his inferior fellow-creatures; it is overclouded
by the anticipation of the coming day which will not
be his. And the essayist reminds us accordingly how “that
great though morbid man, John Foster,” could not heartily
enjoy the summer weather, for thinking how every sunny day
that shone upon him was a downward step towards the winter
gloom—each indication that the season was advancing, though
only to greater beauty, filling him with a sort of forecast regret.
“I have seen a fearful sight to-day,” he would say, “I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
seen a buttercup.” And we know, of course, adds his critic,
“that in his case there was nothing like affectation; it was only
that, unhappily for himself, the bent of his mind was so onward-looking,
that he saw only a premonition of December in the
roses of June.” Waife, in Lord Lytton’s story, checks his
grandchild’s query when, happy, and unaccustomed to happiness,
and therefore distrusting its continuance, she wistfully
exclaims, “It cannot last, can it?” “’Tis no use in this life,
my dear,” Waife tells her, “no use at all disturbing present
happiness by asking, ‘Can it last?’ To-day is man’s, to-morrow
his Maker’s.” Life being a succession of stages, urges another
practical philosopher, we should think of one stage at a time.
Most people, he judiciously reminds us, can bear one day’s
evil; what breaks men down is the trying to bear on one day
the evil of two days, twenty days, a hundred days. “We can
bear a day of pain, followed by a night of pain, and that again
by a day of pain, and thus onward. But we can bear each day
and night of pain, only by taking each by itself. We can break
each rod, but not the bundle.” And the sufferer, in real great
suffering, is well described as turning to the wall in blank
despair, when he looks too far on. To cite another illustration
of A. K. H. B.’s, we should, for certain purposes, look not at
the entire chain, but at each successive link of it; we know, of
course, that each link will be succeeded by the next; but we
should think of them one at a time.</p>

<p>Do not say, <i>wait the end</i>, is a maxim of Paul Louis Courier’s,
who declares that, saving the respect due to the ancients,
nothing is more false than that rule. “The evil of to-morrow
shall never deprive me of the good of to-day,” is one of the
brilliant Frenchman’s resolves. Another brilliant but highly
bilious Frenchman testifies from observation and experience to
the necessity, in the long run, of living from day to day, without
indulgence either in unavailing regrets or anxious forecast,
“on s’aperçoit qu’il faut vivre au jour le jour, oublier beaucoup,
enfin éponger la vie à mésure qu’elle s’écoule.” But it may too
truly be said of this philosopher that he wrote, and lived, as
one having no hope, and without God in the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MEDICAMENTAL_MUSIC"><i>MEDICAMENTAL MUSIC.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">1 Samuel</span> xvi. 23.</p>

</div>

<p>In the days when Saul loved David greatly, and found comfort
in the constant presence of his favourite, it sometimes
“came to pass that when the evil spirit from God was upon
Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so
Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed
from him.”</p>

<p>That there is something more than ordinary in music, Bishop
Beveridge, in his “Private Thoughts,” infers from this fact—that
David made use of the harp for driving away the evil spirit
from Saul, as well as for bringing the good spirit upon himself.
The gentle prelate therefore recognises in music a sort of secret
and charming power, such as naturally dispels “those black
humours which the evil spirit is apt to brood upon,” and such
too as composes the mind into a more regular, sweet, and
docile disposition, thereby rendering it “the fitter for the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Spirit to work upon, the more susceptive of Divine grace, and
more faithful messenger to convey truth to the understanding.”
And he cites his personal experience—<i>experto crede</i>—in favour
of this view.</p>

<p>Anatomizing melancholy, old Burton adds to the instance of
David that of Elisha, who when he was troubled by importunate
kings, called for a minstrel, “and when he played, the
hand of the Lord came upon him.” Of course the erudite
anatomist heaps up corroborative instances of all kinds and
ages, mythological, classical, mediæval; and he quotes many
of those obscure and obsolete authorities whom it has been
the cheap policy of many a bookmaker to cite from Burton’s
<i>thesaurus</i> second-hand.</p>

<p>Spenser opens a canto of his “Faerie Queene” with a tribute
to the powers of minstrelsy as exercised by Orpheus,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Or such as that celestial psalmist was,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That when the wicked fiend his lord tormented,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With heavenly notes, that did all others pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The outrage of his furious fit relented.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or again, to quote a parallel passage from a later poet of the
didactic school, whom, perhaps simply because he (Dr.
Armstrong) was didactic, some people think as essentially
prosy as Spenser is on all sides allowed to be quintessentially
poetical:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Such was the bard, whose heavenly strains of old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Appeased the fiend of melancholy Saul.”</div>

<p>Buretti declares music to have the power of so affecting
the whole nervous system as to give sensible ease in a large
variety of disorders, and in some cases a radical cure. Particularly
he instances sciatica as capable of being relieved by
this agency. Theophrastus is mentioned by Pliny as recommending
it for the hip gout; and there are references on
record by old Cato and Varro to the same effect. Æsculapius
figures in Pindar as healing acute disorders with soothing
songs.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Music exalts each joy, allays each grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Expels diseases, softens every pain,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>

<p>Over Luther, as Sir James Stephen has remarked, there
brooded a constitutional melancholy, sometimes engendering
sadness, but more often giving birth to dreams so wild that, if
vivified by the imagination of Dante, they might have passed
into visions as awful and majestic as those of the “Inferno.”
Various were the spells to which Luther had recourse, to cast
out the demons that haunted him; and of these remedial
agencies the most potent perhaps was music. “He had
ascertained and taught that the spirit of darkness abhors sweet
sounds not less than light itself; for music (he says), while it
chases away the evil suggestions, effectually baffles the wiles
of the tempter. His lute, and hand, and voice, accompanying
his own solemn melodies, were therefore raised to repel the
vehement aggressions of the enemy of mankind.”</p>

<p>A story is told of Farinelli, the famous singer, being sent for
express to Madrid, to try the effect of his magical voice on
the king of Spain, who was then buried in the profoundest
melancholy—proof against every appeal to exertion, living
without signs of life in a darkened chamber, the unresisting
prey of dejection beyond relief. But relief came with Farinelli.
The vocalist was desired by the physicians to sing in an outer
room, which for a day or two he did, without any apparent
effect upon the royal patient. But at length it was noticed
that the king seemed partially roused from his stupor, and
became an evident listener; next day tears were seen starting
from his eyes; the day after he ordered the door of his
chamber to be left open; and at last “the perturbed spirit
entirely left our modern Saul, and the medicinal voice of
Farinelli effected what no other medicine could.” Well known
in modern verse is the poet’s picture of a despairing sufferer,
whom nought avails to move until—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“At last a slave bethought her of a harp:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The harper came, and tuned his instrument;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Then to the wall she turned as if to warp</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nor be forgotten the impressive instance of Schiller’s
Wallenstein, in his hour of darkness, tranquillised by Thekla’s
voice and lute:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“Come here, my girl. Seat thee by me,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Which doth enchant the soul. Now such a voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will drive away from me the evil demon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That beats his black wings close above my head.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>William Godwin makes his savage Tyrell amenable to well
warbled melody. Readers of Scott will remember how a
frenzied Highlander is soothed into self restraint by the
minstrelsy of Annot Lyle. Goethe makes the first bar of an
air by Gretchen suffice to lull the sorrows of young Werter, who
protests that “instantly the gloom and madness which hang
over me are dispersed, and I breathe freely again.” Another
Charlotte—our English Richardson’s—is less successful in her
manipulation of medicinal melody, when essaying to subdue an
angry spirit by the spells of song: “I go to my harpsichord;
music enrages him. He is worse than Saul; for Saul could
be gloomily pleased with the music even of the man he hated,”
But this is antedating Saul’s aversion; in those days Saul
loved David greatly.</p>

<p>Dr. Croly, in an eloquent paragraph of his elaborate eastern
romance, records how carefully music, “of all pleasures the
most intellectual, that glorious painting to the ear, that rich
mastery of the gloomier emotions of our nature,” was studied
by the Jewish priesthood, and with a skill that influenced the
habits of the country. “How often,” exclaims Salathiel, “have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
my fiercest perturbations sunk, at the sounds that once filled
the breezes of Judæa! How often, when my brain was burning,
and the blood ran through my veins like molten brass,
have I been softened down to painless tears by the chorus
from our hills, the mellow harmony of harp and horn, blending
with the voices of the youths and maidens of Israel!”</p>

<p>It is characteristic, as Herr Kohl observes, of music-loving
Bohemia, that in the lunatic asylum of its capital, music should
be considered one of the chief aids and appliances for the
improvement of the patients. In addition to the garden
concerts, in which all assist who can, there is chamber
music—quartets, trios, etc.,—every morning and evening in
the wards; and a musical director takes high rank in the
official staff of the establishment.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Charlotte of Orleans, mother of the Regent,
describes in one of her letters a Madame de Persillie, well
born and well bred, but a dangerous lunatic; who however, if
you could but slip a guitar into her hand when the fury-fit
came on, would become calm again as soon as she began to
play. “I pity her greatly,” writes the good-natured duchess
(whose homely German nature never became properly assimilated
to the French court); “she was very fond of me, and
used to address me as <i>Mon aimable</i>; but whenever she came
to see me I always had a guitar quite ready for her.” It was
but common prudence to be thus prepared for the worst; and
when the worst came to the worst, then a guitar was best.</p>

<p>Schleiermacher exclaims in one of his letters, “Surely, if there
was any good in Saul’s innermost soul it must have been an
<i>adagio</i> that exorcised the evil spirit.” The evil spirit in question
is introduced by name, Malzah, in a recent Canadian
drama, and is made to avow the accomplished fact of exorcism
in the following strain:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Music, music hath its sway:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Music’s order I obey,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">From off Saul’s heart, where coiled I lay.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Which snaky or serpentine similitude is akin to a passage in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Mr. Browning’s “Paracelsus”—distant as the kinship between
the two poems may be in other respects:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My heart! they loose my heart, those simple words;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its darkness passes, which nought else could touch;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like some dank snake that force may not expel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which glideth out to music sweet and low.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again and again in Shakspeare is the remedial agency
of music resorted to by afflicted royalty. At one time it is
Queen Katharine, fading and heartsore, who bids one of her
women cease working, and sing—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Sing, and disperse them if thou canst.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And the singer’s theme is how “in sweet music is such art,
killing care and grief at heart.” At another time it is dying
Harry IV., who prays his attendants, as they bear him to an

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Romans</span> vi. 20.</p>

</div>

<p>In being, and so long as they continued, slaves of sin (δοῦλοι
τής ἁμαρτίας), the recipients of St. Paul’s epistle to the
Romans are forcibly described by him as having been, <i>ipso
facto</i>, free from righteousness (ἐλεύθεροι τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ). But
what fruit had they in the freedom of which they were now
ashamed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all are slaves beside.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They knew that to whom men yield themselves servants to obey,
his servants they are to whom they are obedient, whether of sin
unto death, or of loyal service unto righteousness. There is a
freedom from righteousness, which is servitude to sin; and there
is that service of God which, though a service, or rather because
a service, is perfect freedom.</p>

<p>Gray, in the best known of his odes (best known by heart)
devises this expressive phrase,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Constraint, that sweetens liberty.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It refers to schoolboys, enjoying all the more their playground
freedom for the previous and succeeding restraints and constraints
of the schoolroom. All work and no play makes a dull
boy; but so does all play and no work. In this sense, as in so
many others, does the paradox hold good that half is more than
the whole (πλέον ἥμισυ παντός), and even a schoolboy can find
by experience that a half holiday may be more than a whole
one.</p>

<p>Wordsworth sounds the depths of this philosophy in his
magnificent Ode to Duty. He is fatigued by freedom; he
would be no longer the sport of every random gust; he would
no longer stray in smooth walks, but would serve Duty more
strictly if he might:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Through no disturbance of my soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or strong compunction in me wrought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>I supplicate for thy control</i>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But in the quietness of thought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Me this uncharted freedom tires</i>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I feel the weight of chance desires;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My hopes no more must change their name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I long for a repose that ever is the same.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whose service is perfect freedom—that is God’s service only.
The true character of that service (in Greek Testament phrase,
<i>slavery</i>) is aptly indicated by St. Paul to the Ephesians,
where he speaks of <i>with good will doing service</i>—μετ’ εὐνοίας
ΔΟΥΛΕΥΟΝΤΕΣ, ὡς τῷ Κυρίῳ καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρώποις. The law of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the Spirit of life makes free from the law of sin and death,
that the righteousness of spiritual law may be fulfilled in those
who sometime were free from righteousness. Freedom from
righteousness is, in fact, identical with that bondage of corruption
from which they are delivered into the glorious liberty of the
children of God. He that is so called, being free, is yet Christ’s
servant, δοῦλος. And, as a servant, whatsoever he doeth he is
to do heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men—τῷ γὰρ Κυρίῳ
Χριστῷ ΔΟΥΛΕΥΕΙ. Goethe’s biographer tells us how he
would assert, against the encyclopedists, that “whatever frees
the intellect, without at the same time giving us command over
ourselves, is pernicious;” or would utter one of his profound
and pregnant γνῶμαι such as <i>Nur das Gesetz kann uns die
Freiheit geben</i>, i.e., only within the circle of law can there be
true freedom. “We are not free when we acknowledge no
higher power, but when we acknowledge it, and in reverence
raise ourselves by proving that a Higher lives in us.” We
may wrest to our purpose the lines of Schiller, in <i>Wallensteins
Tod</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nay, let it not afflict you that your power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is circumscribed. Much liberty, much error!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The narrow path of duty is securest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Liberty of will is likened by Jeremy Taylor to the motion of
a magnetic needle towards the north, full of trembling and
uncertainty till it be fixed in the beloved point: “it wavers as
long as it is free, and is at rest when it can choose no more.”
What is liberty? asks M. Jules Simon; and answers, The power
of doing or not doing. But, he proceeds to inquire, can this
liberty exist independent of law?—<i>cette liberté peut-elle subsister
sans règle?</i> Nay, liberty without rule, or law, so far from
ennobling him who possesses it, degrades him. Liberty is not
given to us to withdraw us from the authority of law, but that
we may obey it in recognising its great First Cause. Unrestrained
liberty is our ruin; liberty subjected to law, and that
an immovable law, is the instrument and the token of our true
greatness. Wordsworth philosophically affirms that “all men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
may find cause, when life is at a weary pause, and they have
panted up the hill of duty with reluctant will,” to</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Be thankful, even though tired and faint,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the rich bounties of constraint;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence oft invigorating transports flow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That choice lacked courage to bestow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The truth admits of exemplification in a thousand minor
details of every-day life. Mrs. Gaskell relates how she heard
Charlotte Brontè declare, in reference to the “exact punctuality
and obedience to the laws of time and place” enforced by her
somewhat despotic aunt on the motherless family at Haworth
parsonage, that no one but themselves could tell the value of
this control in after life: “with their impulsive natures it was
positive repose to have learnt obedience to external laws.” In
the last of her own fictions—and, though unfinished, the ripest
and best—Mrs. Gaskell herself suggestively observes of a
patient who, when a medical adviser is at length called in, finds
it a great relief to be told what to do, what to eat, drink, and
avoid, that “such decisions <i>ab extra</i> are sometimes a wonderful
relief to those whose habit has been to decide, not only for
themselves, but for every one else;” and that occasionally the
relaxation of the strain which a character for infallible wisdom
brings with it does much to restore health. M. de Vigny, in
one of his highly finished <i>historiettes</i>, speculates on the nature
and power of the instinct which seems to urge mankind, as by
a kind of necessity, to seek pleasure in obedience, and to feel a
desire to depose, as it were, their free agency and consequent
responsibility in other hands; as if thereby a burden was laid
down, too weighty to be voluntarily supported; and how this
sensation of relief seems to give a secret feeling of complacency,
and a freedom to the act of obedience, which reconcile it to the
pride of human nature. Soldiers, observes Sir Walter Scott,
are always most pleased when they are best in order for performing
their military service; and licence or inactivity, however
acceptable at times, are not, when continued, so agreeable
to men of the camp as strict discipline and a prospect of
employment. “I have heard men talk of the blessings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
freedom,” says Wamba to himself, when suddenly freed from
sharing the captivity of his master; “but I wish any wise man
would teach me what use to make of it now that I have it.”
So Elia, in his essay on The Superannuated Man, to whom
life being now one long holiday has no holiday henceforth;
where he expatiates on the sight of “busy faces to recreate the
idle man, who contemplates them ever passing by—the very
face of business a charm by contrast to his relaxation from it.”
Many an individual experience can put its own private interpretation
on the averment of one of Rousseau’s correspondents—<i>Ce
lien si redouté me delivre d’une servitude beaucoup
plus redoubtable</i>.</p>

<p>Of significant application again is De Quincey’s denial of the
truth of Lessing’s æsthetical assertion, that the sense of necessary
and absolute limitation is banished from the idea of a fine
art. On the contrary, he maintains this sense is indispensable
as a means of resisting (and therefore realizing) the sense of
freedom: “the freedom of a fine art is found not in the
absence of restraint, but in the conflict with it.” So in literature.
That certain rules of composition sustain themselves at all is
due, according to Mr. W. Caldwell Roscoe, to the fact that
creative genius of a high order is not impatient of forms, but
rather loves, on the contrary, to have certain limits defined for
it, and to be freed to some extent from “the weight of too
much liberty.” Shakspeare, he adds, did not fret because
tragedies are limited to five acts, nor Milton quarrel with the
formal conditions of an epic poem. Here again shall we find
in Wordsworth a passage to the point:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In truth the prison, unto which we doom</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Within the Sonnet’s scanty plot of ground;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Pleased, if some souls (for such there needs must be),</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should find brief solace there, as I have found.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The biographer of Edward Irving tells us how deeply he
was affected when the decision of the presbytery against him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
removed him from the range of their control, so that, “notwithstanding
all his independence, the profound loyalty of his soul
was henceforth baulked of its healthful necessities.” He felt
himself with a pang to be cast unnaturally free of restraint—“that
lawful, sweet restraint, ... to which the tender
dutifulness so seldom wanting to great genius naturally clings.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Habits of instant and mechanical obedience are affirmed by Sir
Henry Taylor to be those that give rest to the child, and spare
its health and temper. Men are but children of a larger
growth; and though as regards obedience to a Father which is
in heaven, “mechanical” obedience may not be the word, yet
is cheerfully implicit obedience the thing; obedience is the
privilege of the child.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For obedience is nobler than freedom. What’s free?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vexed straw on the wind, the frothed spume on the sea.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The great ocean itself, as it rolls and it swells,</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SERVICE_OF_FREEDOM"><i>THE SERVICE OF FREEDOM.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> xi. 29, 30.</p>

</div>

<p>It is in tones of winning promise and invitation that men
are offered the wearing of Christ’s yoke. Let all who are
weary and heavy laden come to Him: come, that they may
take His yoke upon them. There is a seeming paradox in
the invitation. Should not the weary be invited by promised
freedom from all yoke-bearing? Should not the heavy-laden
be attracted by a pledge of entire immunity from burdens
grievous to be borne, whether heavy or light? Not so.
Christ’s yoke is easy, but it is a yoke. The burden he imposes
is light, but a burden of some sort He does impose. Being
made free from sin, men become the servants—servitors,
slaves even, δοῦλοι, of righteousness. But in so being made
free from sin, and becoming servants, δοῦλοι, to God, they
have their fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
And the yoke of privilege promised by Christ differs from
the irksome bonds and rigid constraint of scribes and rabbis;
a yoke which, says St. Peter, neither we nor our fathers were
able to bear, inasmuch as it implies and involves a purely
spiritual service—that we should serve (δουλεύειν) in newness
of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. “If the Son
therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.”</p>

<p>Keble says of men, in the “Christian Year,” that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Freely they own, or heedless prove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The curse of lawless hearts, the joy of self-control.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The joy of self-control. For what Wordsworth expressively
calls “unchartered freedom,” as revelled in by those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
ignore a holy and happy-making law of duty, is not in the
long run, a boon, but a bane. True, that, as Cowper has it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis liberty alone that gives the flower</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we are weeds without it. All constraint,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Except what wisdom lays on evil men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is evil.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the constraint that sweetens liberty is excepted; the control
that enfranchises from servitude to self, and exalts to a
liberty which monarchs cannot grant: “’Tis liberty of heart,
derived from Heaven,” “and held by charter;” “a clean
escape from tyrannizing lust.” “Grace makes the slave a
freeman;” for “He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,
and all are slaves beside.” Byron was drawing on his own
bitter experience when he wrote the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lord of himself—that heritage of woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That fearful empire which the human breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But holds to rob the heart within of rest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Imlac, the sage, describes, in “Rasselas” the placid flow of
life enjoyed by a devout brotherhood, whose “time is regularly
distributed; one duty succeeds another, so that they are
not left open to the distraction of unguided choice, nor lost in
the shades of listless inactivity. There is a certain task
to be performed at an appropriated hour,” and the constraint
is to them a pledge of happiness, hallowed as it is with
a Divine sanction, and promissory of “an ampler ether, a
diviner air” to come, in which they shall breathe more freely,
and inhale more deeply, the breath of life.</p>

<p>Freedom is not the being free to do nothing, or to do just
what one likes, and when, and how, without why or wherefore.
<i>La liberté n’est pas oisiveté</i>, says La Bruyère; and then he
proceeds to say what liberty is: “C’est le choix de travail
et de l’exercice: être libre, en un mot, n’est pas ne rien faire,
c’est être seul arbitre de ce qu’on fait, ou de ce qu’on ne
fait point. Quel bien en ce sens que la liberté!” But how
much worthier of that note of admiration the gospel definitions,
explicit or implicit, of <i>ce que c’est la liberté</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>There is a touching suggestiveness in what Frederick
Perthes says in a letter after the death of his wife. All
his doings and plannings for four and twenty years past
had been solely, he declares, in reference to her. “But now
all this is over. I am no longer bound; I can do what I will,
and next to the yearning after her, I am most oppressed
in my solitude by the consciousness of freedom.” Fain
would he be in those dear bonds again; to apply a passage in
one of Shakspeare’s minor poems, he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">“In her fillet still would bide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, true to bondage, would not break from thence.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or as Ferdinand says of Miranda, in the “Tempest,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">“All corners else o’ the earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let liberty make use of; space enough</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have I in such a prison.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this sense may be applied in earnest what Butler writes
in sport, of an independent spirit who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Disdains control, and yet can be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nowhere, but in a prison, free.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So the sculptor in Hawthorne’s tale of “Transformation,”
intent on winning winsome Hilda for his own, “would try
if it were possible to take this shy, yet frank and innocently
fearless creature captive, and imprison her in his heart, and
make her sensible of a larger freedom there than in all the
world besides.” “I have read somewhere,” says a simple
maiden in one of Lord Lytton’s fictions, “that the slave is gay
in his holiday from toil; if you free him, the gaiety vanishes,
and he cares no more for the dance under the palm-tree.”
Don Alphonse, in Madame de Rémusat’s “Lettres Espagnoles,”
writes to his sister an account of the courtiers’ embarrassment
on being released by the king from ceremonial attendance,
and allowed to do each one as he liked. “L’improvisation
en tout est chose assez difficile, et particulièrement celle de
la liberté. Il faut que je confesse que nous n’avons su
que faire de la nôtre.” The moral of the fable may be read<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
in Landor’s lines, supposed to be indited by the caged
nightingales so tenderly tended by Agapenthe, and brought
to Athens for her from Thessaly, and who bid the reader
think not</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That we would gladly fly again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To gloomy wood or windy plain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Certain we are we ne’er should find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A care so provident, so kind....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O may you prove, as well as we,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That e’en in Athens there may be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sweeter thing than liberty.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Apply, again, to the general subject the special fact, by way
of illustration, that restrictions and shackles are essential
to rhythmic writing, and voluntary thraldom the natural condition
of poetry. The Chevalier de la Faye, in his “Apology”
for the supposed difficulties of rhyme in our Cisalpine dialects
(one Italian poet being “distinguishable among his fellow-captives
by the light aërial nature of his fetters,”) suggests
an ingenious parallel to the <i>jets d’eau</i> that ornament the
gardens of the Tuileries, Versailles, and St. Cloud, in a copy
of verses which have been thus Englished by Father Prout:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From the rhyme’s restrictive rigour</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thought derives its impulse oft,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Genius draws new strength and vigour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fancy springs and shoots aloft.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, in leaden conduits pent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mounts the liquid element,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">By pressure forced to climb:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he who feared the rule’s restraint</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Finds but a friendly ministrant</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In Reason’s helpmate, Rhyme.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Pithy and pertinent too are Mr. Coventry Patmore’s lines
on those who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“Live by law, not like the fool,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But like the bard, who freely sings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In strictest bonds of rhyme and rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And finds in them, not bonds, but wings.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They who so live are in every sense the happier, without an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
“except these bonds,” but because of them. They find in
them not bonds, but wings; and thenceforth have free course,
and go on their way rejoicing. They, like the repentant
rebels in Shakspeare’s “King John,” and by the same river
metaphor,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Leaving their rankness and irregular course,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stoop low within those bounds they had o’erlook’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And calmly run on in obedience.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What they are no longer free to do, is to do ill. And that
freedom is as perfect servitude as the service of God is perfect
freedom. In fine, and in the words (but expanding the
meaning) of one of Samuel Butler’s metrical reflections:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Law does not put the least restraint</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon our freedom, but maintain’t;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or if it does, ’tis for our good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To give us freer latitude;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For wholesome laws preserve us free</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By stinting of our liberty.”</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DISCREET_SILENCE_OF_FOLLY"><i>THE DISCREET SILENCE OF FOLLY.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> xvii. 28.</p>

</div>

<p>It is written among the Proverbs of Solomon, that “Even
a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise.” Even
the fool that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
The wise king declares in another place, that a fool’s mouth
is his destruction, and that his lips are the snare of his soul.
Let him keep his mouth closed, and his folly is an unknown
quantity; out of sight, out of mind. Let him keep his lips
shut, and wisdom shall be imputed unto him. Of him lookers-on
will say, a discreet man that. For they are only lookers-on,
not listeners. To listen would break the spell. As it is, they
are apt to count him as deep as he is still. Do not still waters
run deep?</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne—himself a silent man, but no fool;
quite the other way—bids us, in one of his stately sentences,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
think not silence the wisdom of fools; but if rightly timed, the
honour of wise men, who have not the infirmity, but the virtue
of taciturnity, and speak not out of the abundance, but the
well-weighed thoughts of the heart. “Such silence may be
eloquence, and speak thy worth above the power of words.”
Would the author of “Vulgar Errors,” however, have sanctioned
for one moment the reference of the proverb on reticent
foolishness to that limbo? On the contrary, the drift of his
argument is wholly in favour of the proverb; for, if the silence
of the wise is wisdom, as he contends, much more is a tongue-tied
condition expedient in the fool.</p>

<p><i>Stultitiam dissimulare non potes nisi taciturnitate</i>, says the
Latin adage: there is no way to conceal folly but by holding
your tongue.</p>

<p>There is something at once of pathos and almost of
humorous reproach, in the appeal of the Man of Uz, in his
extremity, to his too didactic and complacently dogmatical
friends: “Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and
it should be your wisdom.”</p>

<p>Montaigne exclaims, “To how many blockheads of my
time has a cold and taciturn demeanour procured the credit
of prudence and capacity!” Note the counsel of Carlo to
Sogliardo, in one of Ben Jonson’s heaviest comedies: “When
anything is propounded above your capacity, smile at it, make
two or three faces, and ’tis excellent; they’ll think you’ve
travelled; though you argue a whole day in silence thus, and
discourse in nothing but laughter, ’twill pass.” Elsewhere rare
Ben cites approvingly the “witty saying,” about one who was
taken for a great and weighty man so long as he held his
peace: “This man might have been a counsellor of state, till
he spoke; but having spoken, not the beadle of the ward.”
Denouncing in his strong dialect the vapid verbiage of shallow
praters, Mr. Carlyle exclaims, “Even Triviality, Imbecility,
that can sit silent, how respectable is it in comparison!”
Michelet says of the Spanish grandees of Charles the Fifth’s
time, that the haughty silence they maintained, scarce deigning
even a syllable of reply, served them admirably to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
their dearth of ideas. Silence and imperturbability, according
to the author of “The Gentle Life,” are the two requisites for
a man to get on in the world.</p>

<p>If there are two things not to be hidden—love and a cough—there
is a third, contends Nello, the barber of Florence, and
that is ignorance, when once a man is obliged to do something
besides wagging his head. Charles Lamb shrewdly observes
that a man may do very well with a very little knowledge, and
scarce be found out, in a mixed company; everybody being so
much more ready to produce his own than to call for a display
of your acquisitions. But in a <i>tête-à-tête</i>, he adds, there is no
shuffling; the truth will out.</p>

<p>The Abbé de Choisy hugged himself on the success of a
discreet silence during his residence in Batavia, where he had
special reasons to beware of committing, and of exposing, himself.
“Often when I utter not a word, they suppose it is
because I don’t choose to talk; whereas the real motive for my
silence is a profound ignorance, such as it is best to keep concealed
from the gaze of mortals.” Molière’s sprightly chevalier,
Dorante, counsels a fatuous marquis not to talk of what he
knows nothing at all about—bidding him hope that in virtue of
a scrupulously observed silence, he and the like of him may
haply come to be regarded as clever fellows. “Et songez
qu’en ne disant mot, on croira peut-être que vous êtes
d’habiles gens.” A story is told of Zeuxis, how he reproved a
certain Megabyzus, high priest of great Diana of the Ephesians,
who discoursed of pictures in the painter’s studio with so reckless
an audacity of ignorance, that the very lads who were
grinding colours there could not refrain from giggling; whereupon
quoth Zeuxis to his too-eloquent friend, “As long as you
kept from talking, you were the admiration of these boys, who
were all wonder at your rich attire, and the number of your
servants; but now that you have ventured to expatiate upon
the arts, of which you know simply nothing, they are laughing
at you outright.” Plutarch tells the same story of Apelles.
Again to draw upon Molière: a fool who keeps his folly tongue-tied,
is not to be distinguished from a savant who hold his peace:</p>

<p class="noindent">Not to be distinguished, possibly, from a savant who talks,
and talks to the purpose too.</p>

<p>There are two opposite ways, on Washington Irving’s showing,
by which some men get into notice—one by talking a vast
deal and thinking a little, and the other by holding their
tongues and not thinking at all. By the first, he says, many a
vapouring, superficial pretender acquires the reputation of a
man of quick parts; by the other, many a vacant dunder-pate,
like the owl, the stupidest of birds, comes to be complimented,
by a discerning world, with all the attributes of wisdom.
Silent, quiet people, as Miss Jewsbury incidentally remarks,
have a charmed mystery about them which gives them a great
advantage over more demonstrative mortals; “nobody knows
exactly what they think, nor the impression made on them by
anything; all within them has the prestige of an oracle; the
extent of what they indicate is unknown; and what little is
uttered goes so far.” The best, perhaps, as well as the best-known
of all stories illustrative of our theme, is that of Coleridge
admiring a certain dinner-guest, so impregnable in his sublime
reserve, so inexorably proof against every temptation to join
in the table-talk, such a model (in appearance) of dignified
superiority—until there was carried in that unlucky dish of
apple-dumplings, the very first glance at which roused Sir
Oracle to the enthusiastic outburst, “Them are the jockeys for
me!” Goldsmith had, long before, recorded a somewhat
parallel passage of disenchantment. His travelled Chinese, Lien
Chi Altangi, is present at a dinner-party of dignitaries and dons
in whose company and from whose converse he expects to find
a feast of reason as well as turtle, and a flow of soul as well as
claret. Their silence before dinner is served, rather puzzles
and disappoints the eager expectant; who, however, accounts
for and excuses it by the reflection, that men of wisdom
are ever slow of speech, and deliver nothing unadvisedly.
“Silence,” says Confucius, “is a friend that will never betray.”
The dons and dignitaries were now by the mandarin’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
surmise, inventing maxims, or hard sayings, for
their mutual instruction, when some one should think proper
to begin. “My curiosity was now wrought up to the highest
pitch; I impatiently looked round to see if any were going to
interrupt the mighty pause; when at last one of the company
declared that there was a sow in his neighbourhood that farrowed
fifteen pigs at a litter.” Broken at once was the spell,
and disillusion was the Chinaman’s doom.</p>

<p>Pope, being satirist of the first class, as well as poet of (say)
the second, took care, in his imitative stanzas on Silence, not
to be all sentiment and rhapsodical rapture on that subject.
Hence, one or his stanzas begins, “Silence, the knave’s
repute;” and another declares Dulness to be her bosom-friend:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And in thy bosom lurks in Thought’s disguise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou varnisher of fools, and cheat of all the wise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The moral of one of Gay’s fables is to the purpose—that one,
namely, in which a young dog, ignorant of game, gives tongue
as lustily as if he knew all about it, and gets well lashed for his
pains. To the astounded puppy’s remonstrance the whip-bearing
huntsman replies:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Had not thy forward noisy tongue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proclaim’d thee always in the wrong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou might’st have mingled with the rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ne’er thy foolish nose confess’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But fools, to talking ever prone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are sure to make their follies known.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So a French satirist of the last century bids <i>le sot</i> remember,
that by simply holding his tongue, he will acquire not a little
respect—hopeless as the reminder in such a case may be; for
you might as well counsel the coward not to tremble, as the fool
not to expose himself in words, words, words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Souvenez-vous qu’un sot doit garder le silence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Il serait respecté beaucoup plus qu’il ne pense;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mais vouloir le contraindre à ne jamais parler,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">C’est, sans espoir, défendre au poltron ne trembler.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Could it but be enforced, the one injunction to be laid upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the fool might be condensed into an applied line from Molière,
where Orgon bids Dorine hold her tongue, and regard that as a
standing order:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Taisez-vous. C’est le mot qu’il vous faut toujours dire.”</div>

</div>

<p>All silent people, Lord Lytton affirms, can seem conventionally
elegant. And he tells the story of a groom married to
a rich lady, and in consequent trepidation as to the probability
of being ridiculed by the guests in his new home and her old
one, to whom an Oxford clergyman gave this bit of advice:
“Wear a black coat, and hold your tongue.” The groom took
the hint, and, we are assured, was always considered the most
gentlemanly man in the county. Elsewhere, again, the same
author relates his meeting with a diplomatist of weighty name,
a stock example of political success, but of whom he could
make nothing whatever, except indeed that he was a preposterous
numskull. When, therefore, the Prime Minister, some days
later, spoke to our author of this “superior man,” he got for a
reply, “Well, I don’t think much of him. I spent the other
day with him, and found him insufferably dull.” “Indeed!”
said the minister, with something of horror in his tone; “why
then, I see how it is. Lord ⸺ has been positively talking
to you!” Had he but altogether held his peace, it had been
his wisdom.</p>

<p>According to La Bruyère, everything tells in favour of the
man who talks but little; the presumption is that he is a superior
man; and if, in point of fact, he is not a sheer blockhead, the
presumption then is that he is very superior indeed. His comparative
freedom from folly is positively presumed to exist in
the superlative degree. In another place the same observant
philosopher describes in his best style the sort of people who,
by a grand talent for silence, win golden opinions from all sorts
of men; they look wise, and now and then enforce and re-enforce
the look by a timely shrug of the shoulders, or
significant shake of the head; but the assumed depth of wisdom
don’t really go two inches down; scratch the surface, and you
come to the bottom at once.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PENAL_PREVISION"><i>PENAL PREVISION.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">1 Samuel</span> xxvii. 19, 20.</p>

</div>

<p>Why had Saul disquieted Samuel, to bring him up from
the place of the dead, by the midnight agency of
the “wise woman” of Endor? Because he would fain pry into
futurity, and learn from supernatural sources his coming fate.
The desired foresight was vouchsafed him. By to-morrow he and
his sons were to be with the dead-and-gone seer, whose spirit
he had rashly invoked. The prevision had its present penalty.
“Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore
afraid, because of the words of Samuel.” The secret things
belong unto the Lord our God, and only those things which are
revealed belong unto us and to our children. The tree of foreknowledge
of good and evil may offer fruit that is pleasant to
the sight, and seemingly to be desired to make one wise; but it
is fatal food, not to be eaten of, nor to be touched, by any but
the venturesome profane.</p>

<p>Indulged to his cost with previsions of what should befall his
posterity, Milton’s Adam, at sight of the Flood and its ravages,
breaks out into the exclamation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O visions ill foreseen! Better had I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lived ignorant of future! so had borne</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">My part of evil only, each day’s lot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enough to bear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Warned by so distressful an experience, he would have no
man seek henceforth to be foretold what shall befall him or his
children; “evil he may be sure, which neither his foreknowing
can prevent; and he the future evil shall, no less in apprehension
than in substance, feel grievous to bear.” It has been
asked what would become of men, were their future absolutely
foreknown by them: would they not become in imagination,
and therefore in reality, the passive slaves of an inevitable fate,
with all hope extinguished, all fear intensified, awaiting in
terror the foreseen evil, and looking with indifference on the
promised good, darkened as it would be by the shadow of
intervening calamities, and stripped of the bright colouring of
hope? And yet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With eager search to dart the soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Curiously vain, from pole to pole,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And whether all those years shall flow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Serenely smooth, and free from woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or rude misfortune shall deform</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our life with one continual storm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or if the scene shall motley be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alternate joy and misery,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is a desire which, more or less,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All men feel, though few confess.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So at least affirms the author of the “Rosciad,”—who in
another of his writings puts the query:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell me, philosopher, is it a crime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To pry into the secret womb of time;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To reach events, and read the future there?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Assuredly, says Cicero, the ignorance of evils to come is of
more advantage than the knowledge of them: <i>certe ignoratio
futurorum malorum utilior est quam scientia</i>. And Horace,
in a celebrated passage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>A thoughtful mind, sententiously observes Miss Clarissa
Harlowe, is not a blessing to be coveted, unless it has such a
happy vivacity with it as her friend Miss Howe’s: a vivacity
which enables one to enjoy the present, without being anxious
about the future. It is, according to Goldsmith, the happy
confidence in bright illusions that gives life its true relish, and
keeps up our spirits amidst every distress and disappointment.
“How much less would be done, if a man knew how little he
can do! How wretched a creature would he be, if he saw the
end as well as the beginning of his projects! He would have
nothing left but to sit down in torpid despair, and exchange
enjoyment for actual calamity.” The warrior in Mr. Roscoe’s
tragedy argues judiciously when he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What is’t to me, that I should vex my soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In dim forebodings of what is to be?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is enough I know, and ache to know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What on this bridge of time I have to do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not overlook the abysm till my head fail.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Fortunately for us mortals, Mr. Froude says, necessary as any
future may be, and inevitable as by our own actions we may have
made it, it is kindly kept from us wrapt up in clouds, and we are
not made wretched about it by anticipation. “O my fortune,”
prays Agrippina, in one of Jonson’s Roman tragedies, “let it
be sudden thou preparest against me; strike all my powers of
understanding blind, and ignorant of destiny to come!”</p>

<p class="noindent">Shakspeare’s King Henry the Fourth, again, in one place
utters the aspiration, “O Heaven! that one might read the
book of fate!” Hardly an aspiration, however, as the context
shows; a privilege to be deprecated rather; for could there
be foreseen all the changes and chances of one’s mortal life,
“how chances mock, and changes fill the cup of alteration
with divers liquors,”</p>

<p>Mr. de Quincey describes an Installation of the Knights
of St. Patrick at which he was present, during the Lord-Lieutenancy
of Lord Cornwallis—the narrator’s companions
on that occasion being Lord and Lady Castlereagh, who
“were both young at this time, and both wore an impressive
appearance of youthful happiness; neither, happily for their
peace of mind, able to pierce that cloud of years, not much
more than twenty, which divided them from the day destined
in one hour to wreck the happiness of both.” Vision ill foreseen
it were to know the times and the seasons, the manner
how, and the place where.</p>

<p>The hermit in Scott’s “Talisman,” who, after failing to read
aright the fate of others, has to own himself uncertain whether
he may not have miscalculated his own,—withdraws from the
action of the story with the reflection that God will not have us
break into His council-house, or spy out His hidden mysteries.
“We must wait His time with watching and prayer—with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
fear and with hope. I came hither the stern seer—the proud
prophet, skilled, as I thought, to instruct princes, and gifted
even with supernatural powers, but burdened with a weight
which I deemed no shoulders but mine could have borne.
But my bands have been broken! I go hence humble in mine
ignorance,” etc. In Scott’s other and less popular Tale of the
Crusaders, Eveline deprecates the Lady of Baldringham’s
offer to show her niece how the balance of fate inclines,
and shrinks from the asserted privilege “enjoyed” by their
house of looking forward beyond the points of present time,
and seeing in the very bud the thorns or flowers which are
one day to encircle their head. “For my own sake, noble
kinswoman,” answered Eveline, “I would decline such foreknowledge,
even were it possible to acquire it without transgressing
the rules of the Church. Could I have foreseen
what has befallen me within these last unhappy days, I had
lost the enjoyment of every happy moment before that time.”
So again reasons the Italian adept, Baptista Damiotti, in one
of Sir Walter’s shorter tales, when dismissing the two agitated
ladies who have been consulting his magic mirror. “Few,”
he added, in a melancholy tone, “leave this house as well in
health as they entered it. Such being the consequence of
seeking knowledge by mysterious means, I leave you to judge
of the condition of those who have the power of gratifying
such irregular curiosity.” Cowper observes in one of
his letters that man often prophesies without knowing it;
but that did he foresee, what is always foreseen by him who
dictates what he supposes to be his own, he would suffer
by anticipation as well as by consequence; and wish perhaps
as ardently for the happy ignorance to which he is at present
so much indebted, as some have foolishly and inconsiderately
done, for a knowledge that would be but another name for
misery. Even in the ecstasy of rapturous foresight the Seer
exclaims,</p>

the witch bids them—poor “worms”—crawl back to the
clay—to the earth: “One such night as the hag ye despise
enjoys as her sport and her glee, would freeze your veins, and

<p>Cagliostro, professing to foresee the fate of La Perouse,
is importunately asked by his fellow-guests at that memorable
dinner-party commemorated by M. Dumas, why then he did
not forewarn and save that brave man before setting out. At
the very least, why not have told him to “beware of unknown
isles”—that he might at any rate have had the chance of
avoiding them? But, “I assure you no, count,” is the mystic’s
reply; “and, if he had believed me, it would only have been
the more horrible, for the unfortunate man would have seen
himself approaching those isles destined to be fatal to him,
without the power to escape from them. Therefore he would
have died, not one, but a hundred deaths, for he would have
gone through it all by anticipation. Hope, of which I should
have deprived him, is what best sustains a man under all
trials.” “Yes,” says Condorcet, the sceptical and sententious,
“the veil which hides from us our future, is the only real good
which God has vouchsafed to man.” And what again, to
the same purport, says the Hermit Monk to Alpine’s Lord:—</p>

<p>In a feeling paragraph on the pains of a first separation,
Miss Ferrier observes, or rather asks, if in the long and dreary
interval that ensues, it were foreseen what griefs were to be
borne, what ties severed, what hearts seared or broken—“who
of woman born could bear the sight and live? But ’tis
in mercy these things are hidden from our eyes.” Looking
back upon a certain year’s accumulated troubles, Mrs. Gaskell’s
Margaret Hale “wondered how they had been borne. If she
could have anticipated them, how she would have shrunk
away and hid herself from the coming time!” And yet day by
day, it is explained, had of itself, and by itself, been very
endurable—small, keen, bright little spots of positive enjoyment
having come sparkling into the very middle of sorrows.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>

<p>Not but that this doctrine has found special recusants, if
too generally taken, or, in their own instance, too particularly
applied. “I have somewhere read,” says Caleb Williams,
“that Heaven in mercy hides from us the future incidents of
our life. My own experience does not well accord with this
assertion.” And mentioning one critical occasion, he adds,
that this once at least he should have been saved from insupportable
labour and indescribable anguish, could he have foreseen
what was then impending.—Sometimes the natural complaint
is like that of Duke Ferdinand in John Webster’s tragedy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, most imperfect light of human reason,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That mak’st us so unhappy to foresee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What we can least prevent!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes a solace is found in such a reflection as this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then did I see how that presentient shroud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of grief, which raiseth many a fond complaint</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In mortal bosoms, is a friendly cloud.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Storms fall less heavily which men fore-paint.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the struck spirit utterly would faint,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurl’d from full joy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To be ignorant of evils to come, as well as forgetful of
past, Sir Thomas Browne hails as a merciful provision of
nature, “whereby we digest the mixture of our few and evil
days.” In another of his works the fine old physician would
have us, in the heyday of prosperity, “think of sullen vicissitudes,”
but beat not our brains to foreknow them. “Be armed
against such obscurities, rather by submission than fore-knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
The knowledge of future evils modifies present felicities,
and there is more content in the uncertainty or ignorance of
them. This favour our Saviour vouchsafed unto Peter, when
he foretold not his death in plain terms, and so by an ambiguous
and cloudy delivery damped not the spirit of His disciples.
But in the assured fore-knowledge of the deluge, Noah
lived many years under the affliction of a flood, and Jerusalem
was taken unto Jeremy before it was besieged.” Holy George
Herbert is scarcely more quaint in verse than Sir Thomas
Browne in prose:</p>

    <div class="verse indent6">But thro’ a churchyard which them bounds.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The assured knowledge of the exact minute of one’s death
may be treated religiously as a privilege, after the manner of
appeals by gaol-chaplains to condemned-cell criminals; as
where the clergyman of the Tolbooth Church bade Wilson and
Robertson, convicted Porteous rioters, not despair on account
of the suddenness of the summons, “but rather to feel this
comfort in their misery, that, though all who now [in that
church] lifted the voice, or bent the knee in conjunction with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
them, lay under the same sentence of certain death, <i>they</i> only
had the advantage of knowing the precise moment at which it
should be executed upon them.” But how does Professor
Henry Rogers treat the question, in its practical aspect, in his
so-called “Vision about Prevision”? The seer, or foreseer,
in that <i>fantasiestück</i>, when asked, concerning those who consult
him as to the future, whether some at least do not wish to
know the hour of their death—that they may duly prepare for
it? answers, “That least of all. Not a soul will hear his tale
told to the end; they won’t let us unveil to them the hour or
the mode of their dissolution.... They prefer having a
veil thrown over the closing scene of their life. Like other
play-goers, they do not like death to be actually exhibited on
the stage, and willingly let the curtain fall ere the catastrophe.”
Well, but the seer himself: he at any rate is above that weakness:
he at any rate has inquired into the secret of his end?
“For what purpose?” is his reply: is not that knowledge the
very misery of prisoners in the condemned cell? are they not
accounted miserable precisely because they are to die just that
day month? will not hundreds, who pity them for that very
circumstance, in fact die before them? and yet are not these
accounted happy in comparison, because they know it not?</p>

<p class="noindent">says one philosophical poet. Another, and a greater, in a poem
on presentiments, has this among many stanzas addressed to
them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

Wordsworth commences the stanza next ensuing. When death
has invaded the quiet rectory in Miss Tytler’s Huguenot story,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
we have each servant mysteriously and fanatically delivering
her experience in the matter of corpse-candles, death-spells,
death-watches, etc., so that one might have learned for all
one’s life afterwards to look on one’s death as a dark fate,
haunting and hovering over one’s own person and those of
beloved friends, from which there is no escape, not even by
prayer and fasting; might have learned to “look out for it in
dim prognostications, to watch for it, and anticipate its cruel
blows in incipient madness.—‘Our Bibles say we know not the
day nor the hour,’ said Grand’mère; ‘but He knows—that is
enough.’” One of La Bruyère’s <i>pensées sur la mort</i> is, that “ce
qu’il y a de certain dans la mort, est un peu adouci par ce qui
est incertain: c’est un indéfini dans le tems, qui tient quelque
chose de l’infini, et de ce qu’on appelle éternité.” Byron

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> ix. 34.</p>

</div>

<p>To the three favoured apostles it was granted by their
Master to be eye-witnesses of His majesty, when they
were with Him on the holy mount. They saw the fashion
of His countenance altered, and His raiment become white
and glistering. They saw with Him in glory Moses, whose
burial-place no man knew, and Elijah, who was translated
that he should not see death. And Peter said it was good to
be there, and he desired to make that mount of transfiguration
a dwelling-place, and to prolong the splendours of that
beatific vision. Three tabernacles he proposed to rear, in
that eager impetuosity which so often marked his character;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
at present scarcely knowing what he said, but conscious
of a privileged apocalypse, and deprecating its speedy withdrawal.
But “while he thus spake, there came a cloud, and
overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered into
the cloud.”</p>

<p>So it was again at a later day, and upon another mount,
when the risen Master was asked by His assembled apostles
would He at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
Brief was the reply, and no sooner uttered than, while they
beheld—gazed wistfully, hopingly, longingly, on the Presence
they had so lately lost, and were now eager to retain—while
they beheld, “He was taken up, and a cloud received Him
out of their sight.”</p>

<p class="tb">The overshadowing cloud to mar the sunshine is one
of the commonest of common-places in man’s experience.
Perpetually being verified in prosaic reality, all too real, is the
poet’s image—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><i>Medio de fonte leporum surgit amari aliquid.</i> The very
exuberance of human happiness tends to suggest its opposite.</p>

<p>Gibbon felt simply as a man when he felt what he has
described in a memorable passage relating to his sense of
gratified triumph at the conclusion of his <i>magnum opus</i>. It
was between the hours of eleven and twelve, he records,
on a calm night in June, that he wrote the last lines of
his last page in a summer-house in his garden at Lausanne.
After laying down his pen, he took several turns in a covered
walk of acacias, which commanded a prospect of the country,
the lake, and the mountains. The air was temperate, the sky
was serene, the silver orb of the moon was reflected from
the waters, and all nature was silent. “I will not dissemble
the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom,
and, perhaps, the establishment of my fame. But my pride
was soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread
over my mind, by the idea that I had taken an everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
leave of an old and agreeable companion, and that whatsoever
might be the future date of my history the life of the historian
must be short and precarious.” It is the common lot. It
is but another reading of the complaint in Prior’s pastorals—</p>

<p>A thought comes over us sometimes in our career of
pleasure, Lord Lytton remarks, or in the exultation of our
ambitious pursuits, a thought comes over us like a cloud, that
around us and about us Death, Shame, Crime, Despair, are
busy at their work. He tells us what he has read somewhere
of an enchanted land where the inmates walked along voluptuous
gardens, and built palaces, and heard music, and made
merry; while around and within the land were deep caverns,
where the gnomes and the fiends dwelt; and ever and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
anon their groans and laughter, and the sounds of their unutterable
toils or ghastly revels, travelled to the upper air,
mixing in an awful strangeness with the summer festivity
and buoyant occupation of those above. And this he claims
to be a picture of human life.</p>

<p>Always there is a black spot in our sunshine, exclaims
Mr. Carlyle; and he tells us what it is, “the shadow of
ourselves.”</p>

<p>At a seeming crisis of assured prosperity the heroine of
a French <i>roman</i> is made to exclaim, “The future is all our
own—the radiant future, without cloud or obstacle, pure in the
immensity of its horizon, and extending beyond the reach
of sight.” But while she thus speaks her features suddenly
assume an expression of touching melancholy, as she adds,
in a voice of profound emotion, “And yet—at this very
hour—so many unfortunate creatures are suffering pain!”
So with the young hero in one of Mr. Hannay’s fictions:
“In that moment he felt that he had attained a new stage
of life; yet, an instant’s reaction seized him, as in every
fruition through one’s progress in time comes that curious
moment’s speck, the touch of an unseen hand, that seems
to tell you, ‘Too much joy is not for you here.’ It passed
away, having just dashed his triumph as it always does.”
At a later stage in this adventurer’s career the ebb of his
spirits is made the text of a paragraph comparing them to
a ship in the tropics, where a light wind comes, and dies again,
and leaves you becalmed, or the horizon blackens suddenly
and death seems impending in the unhealthy air. “Few things
are more touching than that peculiar melancholy which sometimes
comes over one in theatres or at feasts, and reminds us
of the dark element in nature and the heart ... which
chills the philosopher and the pleasure-taker.... When
the light southerner of old got a glimpse of it he called for his
lyre and his garlands; but roses will not charm it away from
the deep heart of the child of the Teuton, and he sees its
awful shadow trembling in the wine.” The English Opium-eater
somewhere professes to derive from the spectacle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
dancing, where the motion is continuous and the music
not of a trivial character but charged with the spirit of festal
pleasure, “the very grandest form of passionate sadness which
can belong to any spectacle whatever.” Wordsworth is
treating of presentiments when he says that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The laughter of the Christmas hearth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With sighs of self-exhausted mirth</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They feelingly reprove.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And of such is Currer Bell too treating in a passage that
tells of the writer’s fancy budding fresh and her heart basking
in sunshine; only these feelings “were well kept in check
by the secret but ceaseless consciousness of anxiety lying
in wait on enjoyment, like a tiger crouched in a jungle. The
breathing of that beast of prey was in my ear always.” Ἐξ
ἡδονῆς γὰρ φύεται τὸ δυστυχεῖν.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Who knows what that low sullen murmur means,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The river’s fall sends up to blast life’s fairest scenes?”</div>

</div>

<p>The happiest, as Pope’s Homer has it, “taste not happiness
sincere, but find the cordial draught is dashed with care.”
What biography of successful ambition but has its parallel
passage to one in Prescott’s history of the conqueror of Peru:
“Amidst this burst of adulation the cup of joy commended
to Pizarro’s lips had one drop of bitterness in it that gave
its flavour to all the rest”! As M. Ampére’s Cleopatra owns,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oui, parmi les plaisirs, la joie et les festins,</div>

<p class="noindent">How apt, at a bright banquet, is the thought of death to
flash across the mind, is trite among the truisms of experience.
It was at Belshazzar’s feast, while they drank wine out of
the golden vessels of the temple, and praised the gods of gold,
and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, when the
revelry was at its height and the revellers at their best, that in
the same hour there came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and
wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall
of the king’s palace; and then was king Belshazzar greatly
troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
lords were astounded. In Hawthorne’s allegory of the Maypole
at Merry Mount, the lord and lady of the May are
abruptly overcome with a shadow of sadness, just when the
minstrelsy of pipe, cittern, and viola is pealing forth in such a
mirthful cadence that the boughs of the maypole quiver
to the sound; and just then too, as if a spell had loosened
them, down comes a little shower of withering roseleaves from
the maypole. There is sometimes, says Fielding, a little speck
of black in the brightest and gayest colours of fortune, which
contaminates and deadens the whole.</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Jonah</span> iv. 6-8.</p>

</div>

<p>As Elijah the Tishbite sat down in the wilderness under a
juniper-tree, heavy-hearted, and fleeing for his life from
the grasp of Jezebel, yet requesting for himself that he might
die; as he said, “It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my
life,” yet anon found rest and refreshment under the juniper-tree,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and did eat and drink, and lay down again, and went in
the strength of that rest and that meat, forty days and forty
nights, unto Horeb the mount of God; so Jonah the son of
Amittai, displeased exceedingly, and very angry, prayed in
bitterness the same prayer, “O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my
life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.” Did
he well to be angry? Did Elijah well to despair? Under a
juniper-tree Elijah recovered strength, took heart, and became
of good courage. For Jonah there was preparing a gourd. A
gourd; and a worm to make short work of the gourd.</p>

<p>Jonah left the city in wrath, and made him a booth, and sat
under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become
of the city—the city which he had doomed and God had spared.
Under the burning sun he awaited the judgment of Nineveh.
“And the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come
up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to
deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of
the gourd.</p>

<p>“But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next
day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.”</p>

<p>And when the sun arose, there arose too another thing of
God’s preparing. As He had prepared the gourd, and prepared
the worm to smite the gourd, so, at sunrise, “God prepared a
vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
that he fainted, and wished in himself to die.” And not only
so, but again expressed the wish, with the old bitterness and
even increasing wrath. Did he well to be angry for the gourd?
“I do well to be angry, even unto death,” he exclaimed. The
gourd was so gladdening a creation, it made even that morose
spirit exceeding glad. But scarcely had he time to congratulate
himself on this relief, in complacent assurance of its continuance,
when the sheltering gourd was eaten to the heart by a
speeding worm, and what came up in a night, perished in a
night; and this also was vanity, vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>

show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.” <i>Inter
delicias semper aliquid sævi nos strangulat</i>, says the Latin adage;
the <i>aliquid sævi</i> answering to the <i>aliquid amari</i> of Lucretius,

Ovid,</p>

<p class="noindent">Why, Byron asks himself, in his diary (at Ravenna), why, at
the very height of desire and human pleasure, does there
mingle a certain sense of doubt and sorrow—a fear of what is
to come—a doubt of what <i>is</i>—a retrospect of the past, leading
to a prognostication of the future? Mrs. Browning has penned

<p class="noindent"><i>Semper amari aliquid.</i> It is like Johnson’s reflections on his
first transports at Ranelagh. When first he entered those
festive gardens, it gave, he tells Boswell, an expansion and gay
sensation to his mind, such as he never experienced anywhere
else. But, as Xerxes wept when he reviewed his immense
army, and considered that not one of that great multitude
would be alive a hundred years afterwards, so it went to the
doctor’s heart to consider that there was not one in all that
brilliant circle but was afraid to go home and think; that “the
thoughts of each individual there would be distressing when
alone.” Boswell approves the reflection as “experimentally
just,” and appends a commonplace of his own, upon the
feeling of langour, which succeeds the animation of gaiety,
being itself a very severe pain.</p>

<p>It was in the mid hey-day of military triumph that Paulus
Æmilius astonished his encircling admirers by, first, a prolonged
silence, and next, a sombre homily on the vicissitudes
of fortune, and of human affairs. What time for confidence
can there be to man, he asked, when in the very instant of
victory he must necessarily dread the power of fortune, and
the very joy of success must be mingled with anxiety—<i>aliquid
solliciti</i>—from a reflection on the course of unsparing fate,
which humbles one man to-day, and to-morrow another!
Gladdening is the gourd, with its pleasant promise of protection
against the arrow that flieth by day from a burning sun;

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SELF-PRAISE"><i>SELF-PRAISE.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> xxvii. 2.</p>

</div>

<p>“Let another man praise thee, and not thine own
mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.” Our
English adage, “Self-praise is no recommendation,” has its
analogue in the Latin: <i>Laus in proprio ore sordescit</i>—“A
man’s own laudation of himself is unseemly.” Another bit
of good old Latin admonition is, to enlarge rather upon
the praises of one’s friends, than upon one’s own: <i>Amicorum,
magis quàm tuam ipsius laudem, prædica</i>; which seems to
be, however, but a literal transcript of the second line in
a couplet from the Greek Anthology:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ὑπὲρ σεαυροῦ μὴ φράσης ἐγκώμια·</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Φίλων ἔπαινον μᾶλλον ἢ σαυτοῦ λέγε.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Syrus, again, utters the caution, “That whoso praiseth
himself will soon find some one to laugh at him”—<i>Qui seipsum
laudat, cito derisorem inveniet</i>. It was Æsop’s derisive counsel
to an unreadable author, who did all his own praising and
puffing, and therefore did it well—well, at least, in quantity, if
not in quality—to stick by all manner of means to that home-brewed
system; for it was the poor creature’s only chance
of ever tasting the sweets of praise at all.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ego, quod te laudas, vehementer probo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Namque hoc ab alio nunquam continget tibi.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In one of the wordy encounters between Shakspeare’s
Beatrice and Benedick, the lady imputes signal unwisdom
to the signor, when she tells him “There’s not one wise
man in twenty that will praise himself.” Benedick scouts this
as an old, old apophthegm, quite out of date; for, says he, “if
a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies,
he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings,
and the widow weeps.” And how long is <i>that</i>? Why, an hour
in clamour (the bell), and (the widow) a quarter in rheum.
Therefore, he infers, “it is most expedient for the wise to
be the trumpeter of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
much for praising myself (who, I myself will bear witness,
is praiseworthy).” Shakspeare often expatiates, with dramatic
diversities of phase and aspect, of character and incident,
upon this worldly-wise theme, by the worldly-wise held worthy
of all acceptation, of every man his own trumpeter. To a few
examples out of these many we may recur anon.</p>

<p>Swift is writing after his own humour when he says, in
the work he seems to have admired the most of his voluminous
<i>opera omnia</i>, but to which some refer as the distinct cause
of his never getting a bishopric—“That as for the liberty
he has thought fit to take of praising himself upon some
occasions or none, he is sure it will need no excuse, if a
multitude of great examples be allowed sufficient authority;
for it is to be noted,” he goes on to say, that praise was originally
a pension paid by the world; but the moderns, finding
the trouble and charge too great in collecting it, “have lately
bought out the fee simple; since which time the right of
presentation is wholly in ourselves.” But it is in the simpler
states and stages of society, according to a latter-day essayist on
social subjects, that the man who values himself highly has
little scruple in confessing as much. “Savages have no more
reticence in parading their good points than peacocks.”
North American Indians, and the like, sublimely ignore any
such courses of conduct as that, Not he that approveth himself
is commended. Their faith and practice run counter to
this kind of self-discipline. Chateaubriand gives an example
of the style of chant in which a jubilant warrior, Sioux or
Iroquois, proclaims his doughty prestige:—“Brave and renowned
were my forefathers. My grandsire was the wisdom
of his tribe, and the thunder of war. My father was a pine-tree
in strength. My great-grandmother gave birth to five men of
war; my grandmother was alone worth a council of sachems;
my mother makes first-rate soup. As for myself, I am
stronger and wiser than all my ancestors.” Later Americans,
<i>not</i> of the redskin family, are charged with a scarcely inferior
knack of extolling themselves in all the simplicity of an
ignorance which knows nothing higher or better, and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
being frankly astonished at their own successes. Among
them, it is alleged by caustic Cis-atlantic criticism, nobody
is thought the worse of for praising himself; whereas among
ourselves, “the practice is out of date; a man cannot here
puff himself off with impunity—without in fact, being taken
for a fool; and therefore, if he have ordinary sagacity, he
will keep within bounds.” But not the less, it is allowed,
must the thought of the heart find some outlet; men draw
wide distinctions between pride and vanity, but both have
at least this in common, that they like to feel and be acknowledged
“first;” and both, it is added, “agree in the
instinct to gain their end by a side-wind—to boast themselves
by implication, if circumstances will not permit the more
agreeable incense of positive praise and adulation.”</p>

<p>Plutarch does not blame Cato (the elder) for perpetually
boasting and exalting himself, although the old censor somewhere
pronounces it absurd for a man either to praise or to
disparage himself. But Plutarch <i>does</i> “think the man who is
often praising himself, not so complete in virtue as the modest
man, who does not even want others to praise him.” He takes
frequent note of the habit of self-commendation in some of his
heroes, and of the absence of it in others. Cato, “who was
never sparing in his own praises, and thought boasting a
natural attendant on great actions,” was nothing like so grievous
an offender in this respect, to Plutarch’s thinking, as
Cicero, whose writings, says he, “were so interlarded with
encomiums on himself that, although his style was elegant
and delightful, his discourses were disgusting and nauseous
to the reader; for the blemish stuck to him like an incurable
disease.” Comparing this greatest of Roman orators with
the greatest of the Greek, Plutarch observes of their respective
writings, that Demosthenes, when he touches on his own
praise does it with an inoffensive delicacy, never, indeed,
giving way to it at all unless he has some important matter in
view; whereas Cicero, habitually and systematically, “speaks
in such high terms of himself that it is plain he had a most
intemperate vanity.” Modern critics not a few, German,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
English, and French, have made the most—not to say
made the best—of this foible of Cicero’s. In particular,
Mr. de Quincey makes merry over it, without mercy, at the
father of his country’s expense.</p>

<p>Isaac Barrow points the moral of the text which these
heterogeneous annotations are meant to illustrate, with a special
warning against Cicero’s infirmity. “If a man have worthy
qualities and do great deeds, let them speak for him,” urges
that masterly divine; they will of themselves extort commendation;
his silence about them, his seeming to neglect
them, will enhance their worth in the opinion of men. “Prating
about them, obtruding them upon men, will mar their credit,
inducing men to think them done, not out of love to virtue,
but for a vain-glorious design. Thus did Cicero, thus have
many others, blasted the glory of their virtuous deeds.” It
is quaintly said by Owen Feltham, that whoso makes boast
of the good he truly has, obscures much of his own worth,
in drawing it up by so unseemly a bucket as his own tongue.
“Though the vaunts be true, they do but awaken scoffs;
and instead of a clapping hand, they find a look of scorn.”
When a soldier bragged too much of a great scar in his
forehead, he was asked by Augustus if he did not get it
when he turned his back on the enemy. So, “If I have done
anything well”—this is one of Feltham’s “Resolves,”—“I
will never think it worth while to tell the world of it.”</p>

<p class="noindent">says Shakspeare’s Troilus to Ulysses—modest, valiant Trojan,
to shrewd, circumspect Greek. So another Trojan to another
Greek, in the same play—which Coleridge reckoned almost
the most wonderful of Shakspeare’s all—Æneas, namely,
to Agamemnon; or rather, indeed, Æneas to himself, in
Agamemnon’s hearing:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">But what the repining enemy commends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That breath fame follows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And in yet another scene, Agamemnon, King of Men, pithily
and pointedly tells that stalwart dullard—big, blustering,
boisterous Ajax—who, for the life of him, cannot see the
pith or point of it, that “whatever praises itself but in the
deed, devours the deed in the praise.” Ajax suspects not the
general to mean that <i>he</i>, son of Telamon, is his own praise, his
own chronicle.</p>

<p>One more excerpt from our myriad-minded poet:—“Then
we wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our
deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.” The wise
saw drops from the sententious lips of the sage old steward of
the Countess of Roussillon in what is probably as little read
and slightly relished as any of Shakspeare’s plays.</p>

<p class="tb">Years ago there used to perambulate the streets of London,
a prodigy of a hat, some seven feet high, the trade-mark
advertisement of a hatter in the Strand. This gigantic puff
Mr. Carlyle once made the text for some characteristic
strictures on the puffery of the age. Every man his own
trumpeter: that he alleged was, to an alarming extent, the
accepted rule. “Make loudest possible proclamation of your
hat.” Against which doctrine our strenuous <i>censor morum</i>
objected, that nature requires no man to make proclamation of
his doings and hat-makings; but, on the contrary, forbids all
men to make such. There is not, he contends, a man, or hat-maker
born into the world but feels, or has felt, that he is
degrading himself if he speak of his excellences, and prowesses,
and supremacy in his craft. His inmost heart says to him,
“Leave thy friends to speak of these: if possible, thy enemies
to speak of these; but at all events, thy friends.”</p>

<p>It is Yorick’s skull that Hamlet is apostrophizing when he
says, “Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let
her paint an inch thick, to <i>this</i> favour she must come.” <i>Tôt
ou tard</i>, as <i>le bon réligieux</i> in “Atala” reminds his fair young
listener, <i>quelle qu’eût été votre felicité, ce beau visage se fút changé
en cette figure uniforme que le sépulcre donne à la famille<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
d’Adam</i>. The good king Réné had painted on the walls of
one of the rooms in the Celestine monastery at Avignon, a
skeleton—it was that of a once surpassing beauty who had won
his heart. How would the moral have lost its point had the
head of the skeleton been replaced, like that in the painter’s
room in the Strada Vecchia of Rome, so graphically described
in “Dutch Pictures,” by a mask, or cardboard “dummy” of a
superlatively inane cast of beauty—the blue eyes and symmetrical
lips (curved into an unmeaning and eternal simper), the
pink cheeks, and silken doll’s tresses, “contrasting strangely
with the terribly matter-of-fact bones and ligaments beneath—the
moral to my lady’s looking-glass.” Gwillim, the Pursuivant,
as quoted, not approvingly, in Southey’s “Doctor,” counsels all
gentlewomen that are proud of their beauty to consider that
they “carry on their shoulders nothing but a skull wrapt in
skin, which one day will be loathsome to be looked on.” The
old French poet Villon, <i>aux charniers des Innocents</i>, speculates
in a manner that to one critic recalls the graveyard scene in
“Hamlet,” on the destiny of <i>corps féminin, qui tant est tendre, poli,
suave, gracieux</i>—for how can he help his thoughts running
thitherward “quand il considère ces têtes entassées en ces
charniers”? Who, indeed, as Keats once asked,</p>

<p>Mercury, in Lucian’s dialogue, shows Menippus the skulls of
several world-famous beauties; and the philosopher falls to
moralizing upon that of Helen. “Was it for this,”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he exclaims,
“that a thousand ships sailed from Greece, so many
brave men died, and so many cities were destroyed?” Menippus
was so far of the Ralph Nickleby type, “not a man to be
moved by a pretty face,” with a grinning skull beneath it:
men like him profess to look and work below the surface,
and so to see the skull, and not its delicate covering.</p>

<p>Where, asks the author of “Esmond,” are those jewels now
that beamed under Cleopatra’s forehead, or shone in the
sockets of Helen? With Mr. Thackeray in another place,
again, we take the skull up, and think of the glances that
allured, the tears that melted, of the bright eyes that shone
in those vacant sockets, and cheeks dimpling with smiles
that once covered that ghastly yellow framework. “They
used to call those teeth pearls once. See! there’s the cup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
she drank from, the gold chain she wore on her neck,
the vase which held the rouge for her cheeks, her looking-glass,
and the harp she used to dance to. Instead of a
feast we find a gravestone, and in place of a mistress, a few
bones.” And has not Macaulay his “Sermon in a Churchyard”?
wherein one practical improvement of the subject,
as conventional pulpiteers phrase it, runs thus:—</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">2 Kings</span> ix. 37.</p>

</div>

<p>In the portion of Jezreel—by a retributive local coincidence—were
to lie the mangled remains of Jezebel—what
the dogs should leave of her. “And the carcase of
Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the
portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.”
<i>This</i>, Jezebel? how could <i>this</i> be identified with the superb
wife and superior of the king of Israel, as she was in her
prime of life and pride of place? or even with the faded
form of her that, newly a widow, but energetic and manœuvring
to the last, and defiant in her fall, painted her face,
and tired her head, and looked out at the window as Jehu
entered in at the gate? Imperious Jezebel, thrice puissant
and insatiably presuming, transformed into a heap of bone
dust—reduced to her lowest terms as mere organic matter—resolved
into just so much manure upon the face of the
field.</p>

<p class="noindent">So muses and speculates Hamlet, on the theme of “to what
base uses we may return, Horatio,” when his imagination
traces the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping
a bunghole. ’Twere to consider too curiously to consider
so, Horatio may object. Not a jot, is Hamlet’s answer to the
objection; for look you, Alexander died, was buried, was
resolved into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam.
“And why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might
they not stop a beer barrel?” <i>Quod erat demonstrandum.</i></p>

<p>The Prince of Denmark was in the like mood when, in
other company, he talked, to the same purpose, of how a man
may fish with the worm<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that hath eat of a king; and eat of
the fish that hath fed of that worm.</p>

<p>Well may Juvenal bid the meditative moralist, <i>expende
Annibalem</i>, and expound the text that <i>Mors sola fatetur quantula
sint hominum corpuscula</i>. But it needs a Shakspeare to reduce
these to their lowest terms, in the style of Hamlet with
imperious Cæsar,—a <i>reductis ad absurdum</i> indeed.</p>

<p>Sydney Smith somewhere girds at the idea of doctrinaire
legislators making irrevocable laws for men who toss their
remains about with spades, “and use the relics of these
legislators, to give breadth to brocoli, and to aid the vernal
eruption of asparagus.” Hawthorne once designed a symbolical
tale of a young man being slain and buried in the flower
garden of his betrothed, and the earth levelled over him.
That particular spot, which she happens to plant with some
peculiar variety of flowers, produces them of admirable
splendour, beauty, and perfume; and thus the classic fantasy
is realized, of dead people transformed to flowers.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne—how pregnant his hints are!—touches
on Mummy as having become merchandize: Mizraim curing
wounds, and Pharaoh being sold for balsams.</p>

<p>The heroic dust, as Chateaubriand calls it, of the heart
of Duguesclin, stolen during the Revolution, was on the point
of being pounded up by a glazier to mix his paints. So again
we read of the slaughtered hosts during the retreat from
Moscow: “Some industrial companies have transported themselves
into the desert with their furnaces and their caldrons;
the bones have been converted into animal black; whether
it come from the dog or from the man, the varnish is equally
valuable, and is as brilliant when drawn from obscurity as from
glory.” Cornelia Knight mentions a Parmese canon, who
one day, while the French were in occupation of Piacenza,
found the church in possession of three surgeons, or surgeons’
mates, of that army, “busily skinning” the dead body of
a French soldier. “Horrified at the sight, he asked the
meaning of this ghastly proceeding, and was told that some
scientific men had discovered that the human skin made
excellent leather,” and that it had been therefore ordered that
all dead bodies should be skinned, for the purpose of providing
boots and shoes for the soldiers. Ziska’s skin-deep drum-destiny
was at least a seeming nobler, if not essentially a more
useful one.</p>

<p>Xenophon makes his pattern-prince desirous of having his
body turned to beneficial uses after death, by being incorporated
with mother earth; positively enjoining his sons not
to enshrine it in gold or silver, but to bury it in the ground
as soon as the life was gone out of it. Little would trouble
him the anticipated contingency of such a <i>peut-être</i> as Burns
surmises, in the case of a recently deceased acquaintance—like
Xenophon, a sportsman to the core:—</p>

<p class="noindent">Cyrus, like the essentially practical statesman in Mrs. Gore’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>

assignment of purpose to the ashes of imperious Cæsar:
“It seemed a relief to his mind that emperors, when turned to

than to such a circumstance as “The Traveller” deplores,
that</p>

<p>Have we not heard Liebig indignantly complain of our
importing immense quantities of bones from abroad, thereby
draining the fair foreign fields of their very life-blood—scouring
as we are said to do foreign battle-plains, that the bony
reliques of warriors who fought a good fight in their day,
may now be of further avail to make our bread? An English
satirist of German sentimentalism pictures a contemplative
young Teuton, at dinner time, pausing over his <i>sauer kraut</i>, as
he calls to mind that the churchyard wherein his ancestor
was decently deposited, has been converted into a kitchen
garden; and the conviction flashes upon him that what
was a distinguished man is now on the table in the form of
cabbage.</p>

<p>Have we not, again, heard Monseigneur Dupanloup, Bishop
of Orleans, indignantly brand, as the outcome of current
materialism, such a “practical suggestion” as that of a certain
M. Moleschott, that, in the interest of humanity, “the honour
of the dead should be abolished,” and all cemeteries desecrated
after being used a twelvemonth, that the bones contained
in them may “supply to plants the power of creating fresh
men”?</p>

<p>It is, I think, in one of Mr. Dicey’s letters from the East
that mention is made of the writer’s seeing at Sakhara a
half score of camels pacing down from the mummy pits to
the bank of the river, laden with nets in which were human
bones, some two hundredweight in each net on each side
of the camel; while among the pits were to be seen people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
busily engaged in searching out, sifting, and sorting the bones
with which the ground is almost encrusted. The cargoes were
to be sent on to Alexandria, and thence shipped to manure
manufacturers in England. It is a strange fate, as the tourist
reflects, to preserve one’s skeleton for thousands of years
in order that there may be fine Southdowns and Cheviots
in a distant land; and he stops to muse on the idea of a
<i>gigot</i> that consists in great part of the dwellers in Memphis.</p>

<p>That is a graphic picture the historian of the United Netherlands
paints, of the artificial earthworks devised in extremity
during the siege of Ostend, in 1604, when there was no
earth left for the defenders to use, nearly everything solid
having been scooped away in the perpetual delving. The
very sea-dykes had been robbed of their material, so that
the coming winter might find besiegers and besieged all washed
together into the German Ocean, and it was hard digging and
grubbing among the scanty cellarages of the dilapidated
houses. But there were plenty of graves, Mr. Motley proceeds
to relate; and now, not only were all the cemeteries within
the precincts shovelled and carted in mass to the inner
fortifications, but rewards being offered of ten stivers for
each dead body, great heaps of disinterred soldiers were
piled into the new ramparts. “Thus these warriors, after
laying down their lives for the cause of freedom, were made to
do duty after death.”</p>

<p>Who, exclaims Owen Feltham, would have thought when
Scanderbeg was laid in his tomb, that the Turks would
afterwards break into it, and wear his bones for jewels? But
<i>telle est la vie</i>—or rather, in such a connection, <i>la mort</i>.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Eagles, avowing an inclination to join
in Shakspeare’s anathema on the movers of bones, adverts
incidentally to the alleged fact of Swift’s larynx having
been stolen, and being now in possession of the purloiner
in America,—of an itinerant phrenologist now hawking about
Pope’s skull,—and of Mathews’s thigh-bone circulating from
house to house.</p>

<p>Coupling such corporeal vicissitudes <i>post mortem</i> with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
text with which we started, of Jezebel’s scattered remains
on the face of the field, we call to mind Ben Jonson’s description
(only too historically true) of the dispersed fragments
of him that the other day had been virtually master of Rome,
and so of the wide world. Contending hands have appropriated
all that is left of him: some have ravished an arm,
others a thigh; this spoiler has the hands, and that the
feet; “these fingers, and these toes; that hath his liver,
he his heart....</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> vi. 28.</p>

</div>

<p>Vulgar utilitarianism—for there is a vulgar and shallow
phase of it, as well as a scientific and a misrepresented
one—can surely find little to its fancy (but then it has no
fancy) the invitation, or monition, even though uttered in
the Sermon on the Mount, of “Consider the lilies.” Why
consider them, it would fain object, seeing that they toil not,
neither do they spin? But that is the very reason for considering
them. They are clothed from above with surpassing
beauty, without taking thought for themselves; so clothed,
not for utilitarian ends, except in the large sense that the
<i>dulce</i> too is <i>utile</i>, that a thing of beauty is a joy for ever;
and <i>that</i> is undeniably to be of some “use” in the world.</p>

<p>Herein lies the simple answer to the query in the laureate’s
poem,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, to what uses shall we put the wildweed flower that simply blows?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And is there any moral shut within the bosom of the rose?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But any man that walks the mead, in bud, or blade, or bloom, may find,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">According as his humours lead, a meaning suited to his mind.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">And liberal applications lie in art as nature. The Warwickshire
justice tells Shakspeare, after hearing him recite his stanzas on
a sweetbriar, “Thou mightest have added some moral about
life and beauty: poets never handle roses without one.” But
then Justice Shallow is the critic. The author of the “Citation
and Examination” in which the criticism is uttered, has an
imaginary dialogue between Vittoria Colonna and Michel
Angelo—the former of whom defines the difference betwixt
poetry and all other arts, all other kinds of composition,
to be this: in them, utility comes before delight; in this,
delight before utility. Buonarotti submits that in some pleasing
poems there is nothing whatsoever of the useful. But Vittoria
thinks he is mistaken: an obvious moral is indeed a heavy
protuberance, which injures the gracefulness of a poem; but
there is wisdom of one kind or other, she alleges, in every
sentence of a really good composition, and it produces its
effect in various ways. “The beautiful in itself is useful by
awakening our finer sensibilities, which it must be our own
fault if we do not often carry with us into action.” Leigh
Hunt, in his “Song of the Flowers,” makes them exult in the
fact, by their mere existence demonstrated, that heaven loves
colour; that great Nature clearly joys in red and green:
“What sweet thoughts she thinks of violets, and pinks, and
a thousand flashing hues, made solely to be seen:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent12">“Uselessness divinest</div>

<p>So again Mr. Procter apostrophizes Nature in his “Song
of the Snowdrop,” as having surely sent it forth alone to the
cold and sullen season, like a thought at random thrown,—“sent
it thus for some grave reason.</p>

<p>Bishop Copleston, in his plea for a free cultivation of
the poetic faculty, contends that its being entirely neglected
must prove an irreparable injury to young minds—losing
as they do that intellectual charm from which life borrows
its loveliest graces: hence he takes exception to Locke’s
expression, that educators should beware of making “anything
a boy’s business but downright virtue.” Surely, argues his
critic, the improvement of the faculties which God has implanted
in us is itself a virtue: our attention may be given
in undue measure to one, and so may violate that just harmony
without which nothing is virtuous, nothing lovely. The faculty
itself, which the philosopher seems to condemn, the divine
claims to be one of the kindest gifts of heaven. And why,
then, it is asked, should man be niggardly where Providence
has been bountiful? “Why should he think scorn of that
pleasant land, and undervalue those fair possessions, which
were not thought beneath the care of the Almighty?” In the
garden of Eden, we are reminded, was made to grow, not only
what was good for food, but every tree also that was pleasant
to the sight: and in that garden man was placed, to keep
it, and to dress it.</p>

<p>It is, as Isaac Taylor remarks, by her diversities,—her gay
adornments, her copious fund of forms, and her sportive freaks
of shape and colour, that Nature allures the eye of man, while
she draws him on toward the more arduous, but more noble
pursuit of her hidden analogies. An insensible process goes
on, the effect of which is gradually to invest general truths
with a sort of majesty, as well as beauty; so that, at length,
this new charm is found to prevail over the graces and attractions
of the exterior diversity of things.</p>

<p>Even philosophy, however, has been said to teach us that
nature scatters the lavish beauties of form and colour not always
with a utilitarian purpose; or rather, that beauty—merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
to display beauty—is often, as in birds and flowers and
shells and crystals, the object of material organization. “There
is no special use in the metallic lustre on the plumage of the
humming-bird, and tropical blossoms blaze for the mere sake of
being splendid.” Yet is it owned to be noticeable that only
in the lower ranks of the kingdom of being is nature lavish
of beauty for the mere sake of the beautiful; and that as
we advance upward in the scale of created things, a certain
severity and reserve seem to grow upon nature itself.</p>

<p>Shenstone—a now all but forgotten poet—in a now quite
forgotten ode, asserts, as in duty bound, the uses beyond use
of Nature’s fancy work:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>An art-poet significantly and suggestively writes, in lines to
which the contributory reader, must, on his part, supply readings
as it were between the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This wild white rose-bud in my hand hath meanings meant for me alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which no one else can understand: to you it breathes with altered tone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How shall I class its properties for you? or its wise whisperings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Interpret? Other eyes and ears it teaches many other things.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dull of hearing and seeing, it teaches very little. Josiah
the curate, in Colonel Hamley’s tale, finds nothing suggestive
in a rose in a buttonhole—not that he lacks interest in the
flower in what he thinks its proper place. He never, he owns,
could see any possible affinity between flowers and broadcloth;
and why people should pluck blossoms from the stems and
leaves that harmonize so well with them, to stick them into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
dingy produce of the loom, he holds to be one of the puzzles
of humanity. But Josiah is indulgent to that sister Rosa of
his, who confessedly resembles the lilies in so far that she toils
not, neither does she spin; and who, idle child, seems to think
human beings ought to be content with merely blooming.</p>

<p>We like our churches to be beautiful, and our temples,
and our whole symbolic creations, Mr. Hannay somewhere
observes; their beauty represents the general beauty of the
universe, and that is one of the modes by which God is pleased
to appeal to our faculties of love and wonder and admiration.
“The Romanists call the Virgin Mary a ‘mystical rose,’ and a
beautiful woman is a mystical rose; attractive, and yet, at the
same time, a religious symbol—an object which keeps alive in
you the sense of wonder and love of beauty, and thankfulness
to the Supreme for the glories of His creation.”</p>

<p>It has been said by an art-poet already quoted, that “the
girl who twines in her soft hair the orange-flower, with love’s
devotion, by the mere act of being fair, sets countless laws of
life in motion.” Dr. Croly, in his “Salathiel,” pleading for the
<i>right</i> of beauty to have a natural power over the heart, urges,
for instance, that all that overcomes selfishness—the besetting
sin of the world—is an instrument of good; and goes on to
say that beauty is but melody of a higher kind—both alike
softening the troubled and hard nature of man. “Even if we
looked on a lovely woman but as on a rose, an exquisite production
of the summer hours of life, it would be idle to deny
her influence in making even those summer hours sweeter.”
We may apply the suggestion in one of Mrs. Browning’s last
poems—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What if God has set her here</div>

  <div class="stanza">

<p>The apostle would have his brethren so to use this world,
as not abusing it; and for this reason, that “the fashion
of this world passeth away.” In the original the phrase runs:
παράγει γὰρ τὸ ΣΧΗΜΑ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου. The expression is said
by Grotius and others to be borrowed from the theatre, and to
refer to the scene-shifting of the stage. Life here below has
verily its histrionic aspects; the fashion of it passeth away
much as do the scene-painter’s creations, the stage-carpenter’s
framework, the spectacular effects and dissolving views, nay
the very actors themselves. For, all the world is in some
sense a stage, and all the men and women merely players—</p>

<p>Considering his own profession, the figure is one that must
often have crossed and occupied Shakspeare’s mind—at once
so keenly observing and so profoundly meditative. Not that
he harps much upon it, so much as might, perhaps, have been
expected, in his plays. Still he does now and then recur to
the histrionic metaphor. And it is in his graver mood, not his
lighter, that he does so; in sober sadness, not with gibing glee.

<p><i>Mundus universus exercet histrioniam</i>,—the saw is Petronius
Arbiter’s. There is an obverse reading, by some other old
Eminent Hand: <i>Totum mundum agit histrio</i>. If all the world’s
a play, so again there’s not in all the world a character the
player won’t act. Lucretius had the stage simile of life in his
mind’s eye, when he said of those who hide certain of their
doings, <i>vitæ post-scenia celant</i>,—the <i>post-scenium</i> being what we
call “behind the scenes,” where the actors dress and “make
up” for their parts. And what says a distich in the Greek
Anthology:</p>

<p>When both Swift and Bolingbroke had closed the tenth
lustre of their years, his cynical lordship wrote from Brussels
to the cynical dean, that he thought it high time to determine
how they should “play the last act of the farce. Might not
my life,” adds accomplished St. John, “be entitled much more
properly a what-d’ye-call-it than a farce? Some comedy, a
great deal of tragedy, and the whole interspersed with scenes
of Harlequin, Scaramouch, and Dr. Baloardo.” Accomplished
St. John was always, and to the last an accomplished actor.
As for Dr. Swift, he expanded the histrionic similitude of life
into some eighteen stanzas on the puppet show—which record
how wit, “the life of man to represent, and turn it all to
ridicule, did once a puppet show invent, where the chief actor
is a fool”—and of which, perhaps, the gravest runs thus:</p>

<p>Don Quixote tells Sancho Panza how like human life is to a
play. One takes the part of a ruffian, another of a liar, a third
of a merchant, a fourth of a soldier. This man is for the
occasion the lover; that man is the judicious friend. At last
the play is ended. Each takes off the clothes which belong to
his part, and the players remain equal. So it is in the comedy
of this world, says Don Quixote. There are emperors and
popes, and all the characters that can be introduced into a
play; but it is played out, death takes away the outward trappings
which made them seem to differ, and they remain equal
in the tomb.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole will be found iterating and reiterating in
his letters a favourite apophthegm of his—that the world is a
comedy to those who think, a tragedy to those who feel.</p>

<p>One might safely assume beforehand that a people of so
histrionic a turn as the French would make good use of the
histrionic metaphor of life, in their <i>belles lettres</i>, of whatever
date. And in point of fact the figure is a well-worked one in
French literature. Now it is a Cardinal de Retz, who, on being
named coadjutor to his uncle, the Archbishop of Paris, describes
himself as thereupon ceasing to be “in the pit, or at
best in the orchestra, playing and funning with the fiddles,”
but mounting thence to the stage itself. Indeed, a modern
critic has remarked that Retz is perpetually making use of these
expressions and images of <i>théâtre</i> and <i>comédie</i>. He was an accomplished
actor from first to last—not above the line of low
comedy now and then, and quite an adept in the Cloak-and-Sword
business. Now again it is his contemporary, Madame
de Motteville, who so frequently represents herself as an
occupant of one of the best boxes, intent on diverting herself
with the <i>belle comédie</i> that was being played under her eyes.
“Les cabinets des rois,” says Madame—who ought to know—are
theatres in which pieces of universal interest are for ever
being played: some simply comic; others decidedly tragical,
though so frequently occasioned by the merest trifles. So,
again, Madame des Ursins (the Princess Orsino), another
<i>habituée</i> behind the scenes, and herself a star of the first magnitude
in any working company, describes the world as <i>une
comédie où il y avait souvent de bien mauvais acteurs</i>.</p>

<p>Then, too, we have the Abbé Chaulieu, when dancing attendance
on the Duke of Vendôme, and assisting at all the
fêtes and galas got up in that prince’s honour, writing in a sort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of apologetic strain to his sister-in-law, that since all the world’s
a stage, one must just be content to don cap and bells with the
rest<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>—for if all your men and women are merely players,
motley’s your only wear.</p>

<p>Of another <i>spirituel</i>, and very unspiritual, abbé of that
period, Choisy, it has been observed, that his life resembled a
comedy, rife with all that is most various and most improbable:
his career of fourscore years composed a complete masquerade;
for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“this man in his time play’d many parts,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in each of them he seems to have acted with professional
aptitude, facility, and zest.</p>

<p>Such another actor, with a difference, was Voltaire. As Voltaire
himself said of the Duchess of Maine, “Elle aimera la comédie
jusqu’au dernier moment, et, quand elle sera malade, je vous
conseille de lui administrer quelque belle pièce,” etc., etc.,—so
of the mocking philosopher of Ferney, playing his many parts, it
has been said, that he had a genius for transformations, having
always more than one <i>rôle</i> to play in the comedy of life—which
diversity of <i>rôles</i> jumped with his humour, and just hit the
mobile preferences of a man who so early in his existence
turned player. The life of Voltaire is a comedy, says Sainte-Beuve:
his correspondence with D’Alembert shows us the
coulisses and background—and lets us in to damaging and
disenchanting revelations behind the scenes. Elsewhere he
may be seen to fret and strut his hour upon the stage, carefully
made up, and all in point device costume; but here we have
him in undress, and by dusty daylight, and off his guard.</p>

<p><i>Tous les comédiens ne sont pas du théâtre</i>, is rightly reckoned
one of the prettiest <i>provérbes</i> of M. Théodore Leclerc. In the
Proverbe which bears that pregnant title, a nephew incidentally
tells his uncle, “Vous qui êtes un homme du monde, vous
appelez cela l’esprit du monde; moi qui suis un comédien,
j’appelle cela de la comédie. C’est toujours la même chose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
sous un nom différent.” The salon and the stage are on a
level. To be a real man of the world, is to be an actor of the
first class.</p>

<p>M. Scribe puts the proverb as a practical epigram into the
mouth of old Michonnet, when trying to soothe and inspirit his
pet pupil for the stage: “Calme toi et étudie; ... il y a
dans le monde de plus grands comédiens que nous!”</p>

<p>Indeed, according to Chamfort, there is no choice in the
matter; every man, however wise and unsophisticated and
open-hearted, must, sooner or later, turn actor, on this great
stage of fools. For, “la fortune et le costume qui l’entourent
font de la vie une représentation au milieu de laquelle il faut
qu’à la longue l’homme le plus honnête devienne comédien
malgré lui.” We are all actors and actresses, says one of Miss
Eden’s characters, and “none of us quite up to our parts,
though we act all day long.” Not that every one plays just the
part he or she would have chosen. The distribution of <i>rôles</i>
would seem often to make this a mad world, my masters.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Le monde, à mon avis, est comme un grand théâtre,</div>

<p>This, one might almost paraphrase in the words of John
Webster’s wobegone Duchess Mariana:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>By way of introducing his elaborate narrative of Darnley’s
fate, Mr. Froude tells us of Mary Stuart, that on the political
stage she was “a great actress. The ‘woman’ had a drama of
her own going on behind the scenes; the theatre caught fire;
the mock heroics of the Catholic crusade burnt into ashes;
and a tremendous domestic tragedy was revealed before the
astonished eyes of Europe.” And later again, describing
Mary’s caressing wiles to beguile and tranquilise her doomed
husband, on the eve of the catastrophe, the same historian
employs the same histrionic figure: “Mary Stuart was an
admirable actress; rarely, perhaps, on the world’s stage has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
there been a more skilful player.” But the part, he adds, was
a difficult one; she had still some natural compunction; and
the performance was not quite perfect.</p>

<p>Most of our business is farce, writes old Montaigne: <i>Mundus
universus exercet histrioniam</i> (which the old French essayist’s
old English translator renders, “All the world’s a stage, and all
the men and women merely players”). We must play our part
well, he adds, but withal as the part of a borrowed personage;
we must not make a real essence of a mask and outward
appearance, etc. So it is one of Ben Jonson’s “Discoveries,”
“de vitâ humanâ,” that our whole life is like a play—wherein
every man, forgetful of himself, is in travail with expression of
another. In one of his comedies, rare Ben makes a sham inn-keeper,
taking his ease in his own inn, and following his own
fancies there, “imagine all the world’s a play:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The state, and men’s affairs, all passages</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of life, to spring new scenes; come in, go out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shift, and vanish.... I have got</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A seat to sit at ease here, in mine inn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see the comedy; and laugh, and chuck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the variety and throng of humours</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dispositions, that come justling in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And out still, as they one drove hence another.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For every man, in the play of this world, says pious Master
Feltham, is not only an actor, but is a spectator, too: “At the
beginning (that is, in his youth) it promises so much that he is
loth to leave it; when it grows towards the middle (the act of
virility), then he sees the scenes grow thick, and fill, and would
gladly understand the end: but, when that draws near, and he
finds what it will be, he is then content to depart and leave his
room to others.”</p>

<p>Fielding’s philosopher asks if the actor is esteemed happier
to whose lot it falls to play the principal part, than he who
plays the lowest? and yet the drama may run twenty nights together,
and so outlast our lives; but at the best, says he, “life is
only a little longer drama; and the business of the great stage
is consequently a little more serious than that which is performed
at the theatre-royal.”</p>

<p>An old Greek writer, speaking of Alexander of Pheræ, who
reigned in Thessaly only ten months, and then was slain, calls
him, in derision of his brief lease of power, a theatrical tyrant,
a mere stage king, who, as it were, walked on only to walk off
again. But the palace of the Cæsars, Plutarch remarks, received
four emperors in a less space of time, one entering, and
another making his exit, as if to fret and strut each his little hour
upon the stage. How soon the stage directions, Enter Galba, enter
and exit Otho, enter and exit Vitellius, lapse in <i>Exeunt omnes</i>!</p>

<p>In Charles the Sixth’s ordinance, authorising the players of
the “Mysteries of the Passion” (towards the close of the
fourteenth century), that poor crazed monarch’ styles them his
“loved and dear co-mates.” And what could be juster?
Michelet asks. “A hapless actor himself, a poor player in the
grand historic mystery, he went to see his co-mates’—saints,
angels, and devils, perform their miserable travestie of the
Passion. He was not only spectator; he was spectacle as well.
His people went to see in him the Passion of royalty.”</p>

<p>Players, the abstract and brief chronicles of the time, Hazlitt
calls the motley representatives of human nature. They are
the only honest hypocrites, he says (and hypocrite, by the way,
is classically a correct name for them, though Hazlitt may not
have remembered or meant it): their life is a voluntary dream,
a studied madness—it being the height of their ambition to be
“beside themselves:”—to-day kings, to-morrow beggars, it is
only when they are themselves that they are nothing: made up
of mimic laughter and tears, they wear the livery of other men’s
fortunes, till their very thoughts are not their own. “They
are, as it were, train-bearers in the pageant of life, and hold a
glass up to humanity, frailer than itself. We see ourselves at
second-hand in them.... The stage is an epitome, a
bettered likeness of the world, with the dull part left out: and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
indeed, with this omission, it is nearly big enough to hold all
the rest.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Overbury had, two centuries before, written characteristically
to the same purport. “All men have beene of
his occupation,” writes the ill-starred knight of a good actor;
“and indeed, what hee doth fainedly, that doe others essentially:
this day one plays a monarch, the next a private
person. Here one acts a tyrant, on the morrow an exile: a
parasite this man to-night, to-morrow a precisian,” and so of
divers others.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As we cannot be monarchs, says the Porpora of fiction, we
are artists, and have a kingdom of our own: we dress ourselves
as kings and great men, we ascend the stage, we seat ourselves
upon a fictitious throne, we play a farce, we are actors. The
world, he continues, sees us, but understands us not. “It is
only when I am at the theatre that I see clearly our true
relations to society. The spirit of music unseals my eyes, and
I see behind the footlights a true court, real heroes, lofty inspirations;
while the wretched dolts who flaunt in the boxes
upon velvet couches are the real actors. In truth, the world is
a comedy; and we must play our parts in it with gravity and
decorum, though conscious of the hollow pageant which compasses
us on every side.” And Godolphin pronounces life to
differ from the play only in this—that it has no plot, all being
vague, desultory, unconnected, till the curtain drops with the
mystery unsolved.</p>

<p>All this is in Mr. Carlyle’s vein—of the <i>Sartor Resartus</i> date
at least; or as when he depicted the family vagaries of Mirabeaudom,
which produced “such astonishing comico-tragical
French farces”—with the eight chaotic volumes of family
correspondence, wherein the various personages speak their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
dialogue, unfold their farce-tragedy: “Seen or half seen, it is a
stage; as the whole world is. What with personages, what
with destinies, no stranger house-drama [than that of the Mirabeau
family] was enacting on the earth at that time.” The
same figure Mr. Carlyle elsewhere applies to our own revolution
times, in the century before: “Such is the drama of life, seen
in Baillie of Kilwinning; a thing of multifarious tragic and
epic meanings, then as now. A many-voiced tragedy and epos,
yet with broad-based comic and grotesque accompaniments,
done by actors <i>not</i> in buskins;—ever replete with elements of
guilt and remorse, of pity, instruction, and fear.”</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Act well your part</span>:—there all the <i>moral</i> lies. Though
the world <i>be</i> histrionical, and most men live ironically, says Sir
Thomas Browne, “yet be thou what thou singly art, and personate
only thyself.”</p>

<p>It has been sadly and severely said of the Emperor Augustus,
who was loved by no one, that if, at the moment of his death,
he desired his friends to dismiss him from this world by the common
expression of scenical applause (<i>vos plaudite!</i>), in that valedictory
injunction he expressed inadvertently the true value of
his own long life, which, in strict candour, may be pronounced
one continued series of histrionic efforts, and of excellent
acting, adapted to selfish ends.</p>

<p><i>L’honnête homme</i>, writes an epigrammatic thinker, <i>joue son
rôle le mieux qu’il peut sans songer à la galerie</i>.</p>

<p>Remember, says Epictetus, so to act your part upon this
stage as to be approved by the master, whether it be a short or
a long one that he has given you to perform. If he will have
you to represent a beggar, endeavour to act the beggar’s part
well; and so, a cripple, a prince, or a plebeian. It is your
part to perform well what you represent: it is his to choose
what that shall be.</p>

<p>Thus spake the stoic philosopher. And how speaks the
Christian divine? As the merit of an actor, says Robert Hall,
is not estimated by the part which he performs, but solely by
the truth and propriety of his representation, and the peasant is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
often applauded where the monarch is hissed; so when the
great drama of life is concluded, He who allots its scenes and
determines its period will take an account of His servants, and
assign to each his due, in his own proper character.</p>

<p>Since the life of man is likened to a scene, “I had rather,”
writes John Milton, “that all my entrances and exits might
mix with such persons only whose worth erects them and their
actions to a grave and tragic deportment, and not to have to do
with clowns and vices.”</p>

<p>And this, lest such a player have to echo, in spirit, if not to
the letter, the bitter conviction of blinded, blundering Leontes—<i>Io
anche</i>—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">“And I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Play too; but so disgraced a part, whose issue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will hiss me to my grave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The measure of a happy life, writes Lord Shaftesbury—he of
the “Characteristics”—is not from the fewer or more suns we
behold, the fewer or more breaths we draw, or meals we repeat;
but from the having once lived well, acted our part handsomely,
and made our exit cheerfully—or, to print it as he wrote it, for
the lovers of old books’ sake—“and made our <i>Exit</i> cheerfully,
and as became us.”</p>

<p>It is well remarked by Archbishop Trench that we have
forfeited the full force of the statement, “God is no respecter
of <i>persons</i>,” from the fact that “person” does not mean for us
now all that it once meant. “Person,” from “persona,” the
mask constantly worn by the actor of antiquity, is by natural
transfer the part or <i>rôle</i> in the play which each sustains, as
πρόσωπον is in Greek. “In the great tragi-comedy of life each
sustains a ‘person;’ one that of a king, another that of a hind;
one must play Dives, another Lazarus. This ‘person’ God,
for whom the question is not <i>what</i> ‘person’ each sustains, but
<i>how</i> he sustains it, does not regard.”</p>

<p>His land of Egypt covered with frogs, Pharaoh was urgent
with Moses and Aaron to “intreat the Lord” for him,

Israel. The plague of the frogs abated accordingly, Pharaoh
hardened his heart as soon as he saw that there was respite.
So with the plague of flies that came in grievous swarms into
the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses, and into
all the land of Egypt, so that the land was corrupted by reason
of the flies; again Pharaoh besought Hebrew intercession, and
pledged himself to acts of clemency; and again no sooner was
the plague removed, than Pharaoh hardened his heart at that
time also, neither would he let the people go. Plague after
plague ensued—the murrain of beasts, the plague of boils and
blains, and the plague of hail and fire; and so grievous was the
last—smiting all that was in the field, both man and beast, as
well as every herb and tree—that Pharaoh once more importuned
Moses and Aaron, confessing his sins, imploring forgiveness, and
promising amendment. Once and again he was heard and
answered. “And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail
and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened
his heart ... neither would he let the children of Israel
go.” The plague of locusts, destroying all that the hail had
left, made him call for the Hebrew brothers again in hottest
haste,—entreating forgiveness “only this once,” and deliverance
“from this death only.” But the mighty west wind that
swept away the ravagers had no sooner ceased to blow, than
the hardening process again set in, and the tyrant revelled as
of yore in his accustomed tyranny. How many more plagues
might have been added to the ten—decade upon decade—with
the like result, each facile amendment merging in a more and
more facile relapse, it is superfluous to guess.</p>

<p>So Boileau satirises the “intrepid” scoffer, who puts off
believing in God until fever prostrates him; who is almost as
quick as the lightning to lift up his hands to heaven when the
lightning glares across it, but laughs at poor feeble humanity as
soon as the atmosphere is cleared and the storm quite spent:</p>

<p>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu describes in one of her vivacious
letters a stormy passage she has just made from Calais to
Dover, and diverts herself not a little, as her ladyship’s manner
is, at the distress of a fellow-passenger, in alternations of anxiety
as to being lost herself and losing her smuggled head-dress.
“She was an English lady that I had met at Calais, who desired
me to let her go over with me in my cabin. She had brought
a fine point-head, which she was contriving to conceal from the
custom-house officers. When the wind grew high, and our little
vessel cracked, she fell very heartily to her prayers, and thought
wholly of her soul. When it seemed to abate, she returned to
the worldly care of her head-dress;” and the alternative exclamations
of the distracted creature are liberally specified by Lady
Mary; who then adds: “This easy transition from her soul to
her head-dress, and the alternate agonies that both gave her,
made it hard to determine which she thought of greatest value.”</p>

<p>Lord Lytton, in one of his fictions, comments on the instinct,
as he calls it, of that capricious and fluctuating conscience, belonging
to weak minds, “which remains still and drooping
and lifeless as a flag on a mast-head during the calm of prosperity,
but flutters and flaps and tosses when the wind blows
and the wave heaves.” And an example to the purpose is
given in the case of a selfish uncle, whose orphan nephews are
all but coldly discarded until his own son is <i>in extremis</i>. “Mr.
Beaufort ... thought very acutely and remorsefully of the
condition of the Mortons, during the danger of his own son.
So far indeed from his anxiety for Arthur monopolising his care,
it only sharpened his charity towards the orphans; for many a
man becomes devout and good when he fancies he has an <i>immediate</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
interest in appeasing Providence.” Such a man, in such
a case, becomes at any rate lavish of promises, which perhaps
at the moment he even intends to keep. But how are promises
of this kind usually kept? Much after the manner predicated
of Bajazet, by Acomat, in the French tragedy; a vaguely worded
intimation, but definite enough in its scope: only let the pressure
that extorts the promise be withdrawn, and gone will be
the value of the promise too:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">Vous verrez de quel poids sera votre promesse.”</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Why do these last make so slight an impression on by-standers?
Mr. Whitehead says because it is not a living but a
dying man that speaks; and a dying man who wants to live.
“It is fear that cries out in agony, not penitence that prays.”
Fielding, in his masterpiece, moralises on the truism that be
men ever so much alarmed and frightened when apprehending
themselves in danger of dying, yet no sooner are they cleared
from this apprehension, than even the fears of it are erased
from their minds. It is much later in the same story, that the
“hero’s” avowed resolution, at a crisis in his fortunes, to sin
no more, lest a worse thing happen unto him, is ridiculed by a
cynical acquaintance, as the effect merely of low spirits, and
confinement—with the quotation of “some witticisms about
the devil when he was sick.” The epigram in question is a
favourite allusion with novelists and moralists of all sorts and
sizes. There is a border freebooter of Scott’s, who, having
recovered from a severe illness, thanks to the medical skill of
the Black Dwarf, greets his benefactor, on horseback, all in
bandit array, as soon as convalescent. “So,” said the dwarf,
“rapine and murder once more on horseback!” “On horseback?”
said the bandit; “ay, ay, Elshie, your leech-craft has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
set me on the bonnie bay again.” “And all those promises of
amendment which you made during your illness forgotten?”
continued Elshender. “All clear away, with the water-saps
and panada,” returned the unabashed convalescent. “Ye ken,
Elshie, for they say ye are weel acquent wi’ the gentleman,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“‘When the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the devil was well, the devil a monk was he.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For it is not every vow taken in a panic, to become a monk if
spared, that is kept as Luther’s was—“devil” though the anti-Lutherans
of his day might account and call him. Young
Martin saw one of his friends struck dead by his side, by a
stroke of lightning, in 1505; and the sight moved him to utter
on the instant a vow to St. Anne that he would become a monk
if he were himself spared. “The danger passed over, but he
did not seek to elude an engagement wrung from him in terror.
He solicited no dispensation from his vow.” Brother Martin
<i>ipso facto</i> approved himself no member of the fraternity of what
Le Sage calls <i>vous autres, messieurs les diables</i>, in a passage that
indirectly bears upon our theme, for it refers to the proverbial
worthlessness of promises coming from that quarter: “Voilà
de belles promesses, répliqua l’Ecolier; mais vous autres,
messieurs les diables, on vous accuse de n’être pas fort réligieux
à tenir ce que vous promettez.” The epigram runs, if not
rhymes, as well in Latin as in English:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ægrotat dæmon, monachus tunc esse volebat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dæmon convaluit, dæmon ut ante fuit.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Referring to proverbs of this kind it is that Archbishop
Trench says, that sometimes an adage, without changing its
shape altogether, will yet on the lips of different nations be
slightly modified—the modifications, slight as they often are,
being not the less eminently characteristic. “Thus in English
we say, <i>The river past, and God forgotten</i>, to express with how
mournful a frequency He whose assistance was invoked, it may
have been earnestly, in the moment of peril, is remembered no
more, so soon as by His help the danger has been surmounted.
The Spaniards have the proverb too; but it is with them: <i>The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
river past, the saint forgotten</i>: the saints being in Spain more
prominent objects of invocation than God. And the Italian
form of it sounds a still sadder depth of ingratitude: <i>The peril
passed, the saint mocked</i>.” Men indulge in doubts of a Supreme
Being, says La Bruyère, when they are lusty and strong; but
with sickness comes belief, such as it is. “L’on doute de Dieu
dans une pleine santé.... Quand on devient malade, et que
l’hydropisie est formée ... l’on croit en Dieu.” Believes?
As to that, the devils believe, and tremble. But how when
the dropsy is relieved and the trembling fit over? Dr. Johnson
once adverted in conversation with Seward and Boswell to
the evil life he led until sickness wrought a reformation, which,
in his case, had been lasting. Mr. Seward thereupon observed:
“One should think that sickness, and the view of death, would
make more men religious.” But Johnson replied to this: “Sir,
they do not know how to go about it; they have not the first
notion. A man who has never had religion before, no more
grows religious when he is sick than a man who has never
learnt figures can count when he has need of calculation.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
It is to be observed that the doctor claimed for himself a
previous regard for religion in quite early life; for some years
it had, to use his own phrase, “dropped out of his mind,” but
“sickness brought it back,” and he hoped he had never lost it
since.</p>

<p>It is an old, old story, that of the generation which tempted
God in the desert, whose days He therefore consumed in
vanity, and their years in trouble. When He slew them, then
they sought Him; and they returned, and inquired early after
God. But it was only to start aside again, like a broken bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>There is a passage in Montesquieu’s Persian Letters that
reads like a paraphrase and expansion of this: “Quand le
médecin est auprès de mon lit, le confesseur me trouve à son
avantage. Je sais bien empêcher la religion de m’affliger quand
je me porte bien; mais je lui permets de me consoler quand
je suis malade: lorsque je n’ai plus rien à espérer d’un côté,
la religion se présente, et me gagne,” etc. Plutarch tells us of
Tullus Hostilius, that he exulted in irreligious opinions while
in health, but was frightened into superstition when taken ill.
To this passage, one of Plutarch’s translators, Dr. Langhorne,
appends a footnote, about none being so superstitious in distress
as those who, in their prosperity, have laughed at religion;
and cites as an instance the famous Canon Vossius, who was
“no less remarkable for the greatness of his fears, than he was
for the littleness of his faith.” Cowper would cite to the same
purpose a more distinguished example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“The Frenchman first in literary fame;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, then a text would touch him to the quick.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Swift gives a satirical narrative of “what passed in
London during the general consternation of all ranks and
degrees of mankind” on account of the predicted destruction
of the world by a comet, on a given day. Friday was the
declared day; and during Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
public bewilderment and terror are described as extreme—the
churches crowded, and thousands praying in the public streets.
At length Friday came. But as the day wore on, popular
fears began to abate, then lessened every hour; “at night they
were almost extinct, till the total darkness that hitherto used
to terrify, now comforted every freethinker and atheist. Great
numbers went together to the taverns, bespoke suppers, and
broke up whole hogsheads for joy. The subject of all wit and
conversation was to ridicule the prophecy and rally each other.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
All the quality and gentry were perfectly ashamed, nay, some
utterly disowned that they had manifested any signs of religion.</p>

<p>“But the next day, even the common people, as well as their
betters, appeared in their usual state of indifference. They
drank, they swore, they lied, they cheated, they quarrelled, they
murdered. In short, the world went on in the old channel.”</p>

<p>To apply what Butler says of “saints” in his application of
the word, as a cant term then of political significance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For saints in peace degenerate,</div>

<p>That is a fine stroke of nature, in the Knight’s Tale (from
Chaucer), where Dryden makes Arcite resolve, only when and
not until moribund, to avow the wrong he has done to
Palamon, and own his fear of repeating it should he recover:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">With her, at his desire, came Palamon;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">to whom Arcite owns the faithless part he has played, and
desires forgiveness, but at the same time makes this frank
avowal:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“And much I doubt, should Heaven my life prolong,</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Treating of missions in Abyssinia in the sixteenth century,
Gibbon relates how, in a moment of terror, the emperor promised
to reconcile himself and his subjects to the Catholic
faith. “But the vows,” adds the historian, “which pain had
extorted, were forsworn on the return of health.” Swift again,
in his history of England,—for the Dean of St. Patrick wrote
one—tells how William Rufus fell dangerously sick at Gloucester,
on his return from Scotland, and being moved by the fears
of dying, began to discover great marks of repentance, with
many promises of amendment and retribution. “But as it is
the disposition of men who derive their vices from their complexions,
that their passions usually beat strong and weak with
their pulses, so it fared with this prince, who, upon recovery
of his health, soon forgot the vows he had made in his sickness,
relapsing with greater violence into the same irregularities,” etc.</p>

<p>Michael Germain—who, however, is allowed to have looked
upon the religious observances of Rome with the eye of a
French encyclopédiste—makes merry, as one of Mabillon’s
Italian expedition (in 1685), at the expense of that indolent
and hypochondriacal Pope (so Sir James Stephen calls him),
Innocent XI. “If I should attempt,” writes this French
Benedictine, “to give you an exact account of the health of
his Holiness, I must begin with Ovid, ‘In nova fert animus
mutatas dicere formas.’ At ten he is sick, at fifteen well again,
at eighteen eating as much as four men, at twenty-four dropsical....
The worst of it is, that they say he has given up
all thoughts of creating new cardinals, forgetting in his restored
health the scruples he felt when sick; like other great sinners;”
like Louis XV., for instance, at the commencement of whose
last illness Mr. Carlyle so vividly depicts the consternation of
the infamous Du Barry, lest she should have to take flight, as
her predecessors had been constrained to do when the Well-beloved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
(Bien-aimé) had been sick before. “Should the Most
Christian King die, or even get seriously afraid of dying! For,
alas! had not the fair, haughty Chateauroux to fly, with wet
cheeks and flaming heart, from that fever scene at Metz, long
since; driven forth by sour shavelings? She hardly returned,
when fever and shavelings were both swept into the background.
Pompadour, too, when Damiens wounded Royalty
‘slightly, under the fifth rib,’ ... had to pack, and be in
readiness; yet did not go, the wound not proving poisoned.”
His Most Christian Majesty was of no distant kin with that
profligate viscount in Mr. Thackeray’s story, who used to recount
misdeeds “with rueful remorse when he was ill, for the
fear of death set him instantly repenting; and with shrieks of
laughter when he was well, his lordship having a very great
sense of humour.” Of the same kindred comes the same
author’s Miss Crawley, as we see her ill with fright, in her
lonely, loveless old age. When in health and good spirits, this
venerable inhabitant of Vanity Fair, we are assured, had as free
notions about religion and morals as Monsieur de Voltaire himself
could desire; but “when illness overtook her, it was aggravated
by the most dreadful terrors of death, and an utter
cowardice took possession of the prostrate old sinner.” Nor
be forgotten, as a scion of the same stock, that puffy, pursy,
pusillanimous creature, Jos. Sedley, of whom we read that, in
the course of his voyage home from Bengal, he disappeared in
a panic during a two-days’ gale, and remained in his cot reading
a religious tract left on board by a missionary’s wife; while,
“for common reading he had brought a stock of novels and
plays,” to which of course he would return with all the more
zest and devotion when the perils of the gale were past.</p>

<p>Comparing the influence on the mind of danger of death,
and of danger from a storm, or from some other external cause
than sickness, Archbishop Whately ascribes to the storm a
much larger virtue of “wholesome discipline” than to the
deadly sickness. He says, “The well-known proverb, ‘The
devil was sick,’ etc., shows how generally it has been observed
that people, when they recover, forget the resolutions formed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
during sickness. One reason of the difference, and perhaps
the chief, is, that it is so much easier to <i>recall</i> exactly the sensations
felt when in perfect health and yet in imminent danger,
and to act over again, as it were, in imagination, the whole
scene, than to recall fully, when in health, the state of mind
during some sickness, which itself so much affects the mind
along with the body.”</p>

<p>And yet the effects defective of a storm are a commonplace
with the satirists. Peter Pindar devotes a “poem” to the subject;
and a greater poet—if the said Peter can be called poet
at all—has a forcible stanza on the equinoxes, when the Parcæ
cut short the further spinning</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SLEEP_AND_DEATH"><i>SLEEP AND DEATH.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. John</span> xi. 11-14.</p>

</div>

<p>To His disciples our Lord spoke of His friend, and theirs,
“our friend, Lazarus,” as sleeping; intimating at the
same time His intention of going on to Bethany, that He
might awaken him out of sleep. “Then said His disciples,
Lord, if he sleep he shall do well. Howbeit, Jesus spake of
his death; but they thought that He had spoken of taking of
rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is
dead.”</p>

<p>The affinity of sleep to death is familiarly recognised in the
Old Testament as in the New; indeed, in universal literature
of whatever age, sacred and profane. Bathsheba anticipates
the day, only too near at hand, when her lord the king “shall
sleep with his fathers.” Daniel foretells the awaking of many
that sleep in the dust of the earth. The psalmist utters a
deprecation lest he sleep the sleep of death. Jesus declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
the sick maiden to be not dead, but sleeping; and was laughed
to scorn by those who <i>knew</i> that she was dead. Them that
sleep in Jesus, saith the apostle, will God bring with Him.
We shall not all sleep, he says elsewhere, but we shall all be
changed.</p>

<p>Homer personifies a dualism of “Sleep and Death, two
twins of wingèd race, of matchless swiftness, but of silent
pace;” and he makes the friends of Sarpedon “his sacred
corse bequeath to the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.”
He pictures Aphrodite speeding to Lemnos o’er the rolling deep,
to “seek the cave of Death’s half-brother, Sleep.” The dying
Gorgias, we are told, being in a slumber, and asked how he did,
answered, “Pretty well; only Sleep is commending me to the
charge of his brother.” Samuel Daniel apostrophizes “Care-charmer
Sleep, son of the sable Night, brother to Death, in
silent darkness born;” and so too, Beaumont and Fletcher
apostrophize him in almost the selfsame words. So again their
contemporary, John Webster, “O thou soft natural Death, that
art joint twin to sweetest slumber!” Cowley’s ode <i>in memoriam</i>
of William Harvey, begins with sombre commemoration of a
dismal and a fearful night, “when sleep, death’s image, left his
troubled breast, by something liker death possest.” And the
last verse of Denham’s “Song to Morpheus” identifies the
twins,—practically makes a hendiadys of them, as grammarians
might call it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Warton’s Latin epigram on sleep, as <i>certissima mortis imago</i>,
has been Englished by Wolcot with a beauty and felicity pronounced
by critics to be worthy of the original:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">How sweet, though lifeless, yet with life to lie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, without dying, O how sweet to die!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shelley’s opening of “Queen Mab” is a stock quotation:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
“How wonderful is Death, Death and his brother Sleep! one
pale as yonder waning moon, with lips of lurid blue; the other
rosy as the morn when, throned on ocean’s wave, it blushes
o’er the world: yet both so passing wonderful!” But where,
asks a prose writer of genius, where, in the sharp lineaments
of rigid and unsightly death, is the calm beauty of slumber,
telling of rest for the waking hours that are past, and gentle
hopes and loves for those which are to come? “Lay death
and sleep down, side by side, and say who shall find the two
akin.” But this is selecting such an aspect of mortality as
comes not within the poet’s purview. Prosaical in every fibre
is Sancho Panza meant to be; yet in his famous invocation of
blessings on the invention, or rather on the inventor, of sleep,
which, quoth he, “covers a man all over, body and mind, like
a cloak”—for Sancho has his poetical moods and tenses after
all—he goes on to recognise the affinity which poetry so freely
asserts: “It [sleep] has only one fault, as I have heard say, which
is, that it looks like death: for between the sleeper and the
corpse there is but little to choose.” Shakspeare’s Iachimo
calls sleep the “ape of death.” To die, to sleep,—muses
Hamlet,—no more; and, by a sleep, to say we end the heart-ache,
and the thousand natural ills that flesh is heir to, were a
consummation devoutly to be wished. “Thy best of rest is
sleep,” soliloquizes the duke in “Measure for Measure,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear’st</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy death, which is no more.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A couplet of Butler’s, in a description of nightfall, tells how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">... “sleep the wearied world relieved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By counterfeiting death revived.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>A Greek proverb designates sleep “the minor mysteries of
death”—in allusion to the lesser Eleusinian mysteries as compared
with the greater: “ὕπος τὰ μικρὰ τοῦ θανάτου μυστήρια.” Sir
Thomas Overbury calls sleep, death’s picture drawn to the life,
or the twilight of life and death. “In sleep we kindly shake
death by the hand; but when we are awaked, we will not know
him.” With the closing clause of this sentence compare the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
closing lines in the following picture by Byron, of man
o’erlaboured with his being’s strife, shrinking to “that sweet
forgetfulness of life” which sleep induces:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There lie love’s feverish hope and cunning’s guile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hate’s working brain, and lull’d ambition’s wile;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er each vain eye oblivion’s pinions wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And quench’d existence crouches in a grave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What better name may slumber’s bed become?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Night’s sepulchre, the universal home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where weakness, strength, vice, virtue, sunk supine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alike in naked helplessness recline;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glad for awhile to heave unconscious breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet wake to wrestle with the dread of death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shun, though day but dawn on ills increast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sleep, the loveliest, since it dreams the least.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We term sleep a death, writes Sir Thomas Browne, and yet
it is waking that kills us, and destroys those spirits that are the
house of life. “It is that death by which we may be literally
said to die daily; a death which Adam died before his mortality;
a death whereby we live a middle and moderating point between
life and death.” And then the golden-tongued physician—in
his <i>Religio Medici</i>—goes on to say that, in fine, so like death
seemed to him sleep, that he dare not trust it without his
prayers, and a half adieu to the world; and taking his farewell
“in a colloquy with God,” that is set in the key of the Evening
Hymn, where we pray to be taught to dread the grave as little
as our bed. So, in verses of his own weaving, this consummate
master of stately rhetorical prose, beseeches God to make his
sleep a holy trance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sleep is a death;—O make me try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By sleeping, what it is to die!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as gently lay my head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On my grave, as now my bed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Howe’er I rest, great God, let me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awake again at last with Thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thus assured, behold I lie</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Securely, or to wake or die.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These are my drowsy days; in vain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I do now wake to sleep again:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">O come that hour when I shall never</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleep again, but wake for ever!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“This is the dormitive I take to bedward; I need no other
laudanum than this to make me sleep; after which I close my
eyes in security, content to take leave of the sun, and sleep
unto the resurrection.”</p>

<p>George Herbert says, that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When boys go first to bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They step into their voluntary graves;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleep binds them fast; only their breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes them not dead.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Successive nights, like rolling waves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Convey them quickly, who are bound for death.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ye children, does death ever alarm you? asks the venerable
pastor in Tegner’s <i>Children of the Lord’s Supper</i>: “Death is the
brother of Love, twin-brother is he, and is only more austere to
behold.” Shakspeare’s nobleman is gazing with disgust on a
sottish sleeper, when he exclaims, “Grim death, how foul and
loathsome is thine image!” That image, as embodied in the
form of a little child, has often inspired poets to strains of tender
admiration. Malaspina, in one of Landor’s unacted (not to say,
with almost equal truth, unread) plays thus contemplates, and
apostrophizes, such an image:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And still thou sleepest, my sweet babe! Is death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like sleep? Ah, who then, who would fear to die?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How beautiful is all serenity!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleep, a child’s sleep, oh how far more serene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And oh, how far more beautiful than any!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether we breathe so gently, or breathe not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slight is the difference.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>More familiar to every one in the least conversant with
current literature—not ephemeral in its currency, or running so
fast as to be, like that which decayeth and waxeth old, ready to
vanish away—is Mrs. Browning’s poem on a sleeping child—tired
out with playing, and slumbering on the floor; the latter
portion alone of which may here find room:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ELIAB_AND_DAVID_IN_THE_VALLEY_OF_ELAH"><i>ELIAB AND DAVID IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">1 Samuel</span> xvii. 28.</p>

</div>

<p>When the Spirit of God came upon Saul, so that he
prophesied among the company of prophets that met
him, all that knew him beforetime asked one another what was
this that was come to the son of Kish? was Saul also among
the prophets? Insomuch that it became a proverb, “Is Saul
also among the prophets?” No prophet is accepted in his own
country; <i>that</i> is become a proverb too. And as with Saul, a
young man among the prophets, so with youthful David among
the men of war from their youth. Eliab, his eldest brother,
knew, as he thought, the pride and the naughtiness of his heart
in coming down to the camp to see the battle; but he knew
not what sterling stuff there was in the stripling. <i>Why</i> had
Jesse’s youngest son come down hither? and with whom had
he left those few sheep in the wilderness? Eliab’s anger was
kindled against David for his presumptuous and idle curiosity.
His scorn was well-nigh as supreme as that of Goliath himself
for the youth,—for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair
countenance. Quit his proper rusticities and retirement for the
valley of Elah, that bristled with spear-heads and resounded
with the din of battle! a boy like him, that should be feeding
his father’s sheep at Bethlehem! Was there not a cause?
None that Eliab knew of, for one. He had never seen anything
in the lad to warrant this forwardness. Not to Eliab or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
his brethren was it given to foresee in that fresh-coloured shepherd
boy the present slayer of Goliath of Gath, and the bosom
friend of princely Jonathan, and the paulo-post-future king of
Israel, Israel’s sweetest singer, and the man after God’s own
heart.</p>

<p class="tb">The adage about unrecognised worth, on the part of kinsfolk
and neighbours, the proverb of the prophet without honour in
his own country and in his father’s house—has its parallel
passage in the <i>Hercules Furens</i> of Euripides—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">... “οὑ γὰρ ἐσθ’ ὅπου</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Εσθλόν τι δράσας μάρτυρ’ ἂν λάβοις πάτραν.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Plutarch adopts it in his treatise on Exile, where he says that
you very rarely find a wise man taken for such in his own
country: “τῶν φρονιμωτάτων καὶ σοφωτάτων ὀλίγους ἂν εὕροις ἐν ταῖς
ἑαυτῶν πατρίσι κεκηδευμένους.”</p>

<p>The tradition that Pythagoras borrowed all his learning and
philosophy from the East is rejected by modern scholars: could
not so great a man, they ask, dispense with foreign teachers?
And the answer is, that assuredly he could and did; but his
countrymen, it is to be observed, by a very natural process of
thought, looked upon his greatness as the result of his Eastern
education. “No man is a prophet in his own country, and the
imaginative Greeks were peculiarly prone to invest the distant
and the foreign with striking attributes;” unable to believe in
wisdom springing up from among themselves, they turned to
the East as to a vast and unknown region, whence all novelty,
even of thought, must come. “Πᾶσι τοῖς φιλοσόφοις,” says a
Greek philosopher, “ἔδοξε χαλεπὸς ἐν τῇ πατρίδι ὁ βίος.”</p>

<p>As the first, so the most arduous conquests of Mohammed
were, says Gibbon, those of his wife, his servant, his pupil, and
his friend; since he presented himself as a prophet to those
who were most conversant with his infirmities as a man. “Thus
was Mohammed,” writes Dean Milman, after recording the
conversion of the child Ali, “the prophet of his household.
Slowly however did he win proselytes, even among his own
kindred. Three years elapsed before the faith received the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
accession of Abubeker and of Othman, the future caliphs.
Mohammed at length is accepted as the prophet of his family,
of the noble and priestly house of Hashem. Abu Talib, his
uncle, remains almost alone an unbeliever. And now Mohammed
aspires to be the prophet of his <i>tribe</i>.” But in effect the
“false” prophet is an exception to the rule of no prophet
accepted in his own house and country. An American commentator
on Shakspeare incidentally expounds that rule, in
remarking on the degree to which our sense of truth is impeded
or impaired by the pressure on our minds of what is actual and
visible and present. A faithful painter may, he observes, portray
a human face with all its characteristic expression, and in
all its true individuality; and yet the nearest relatives are not
only the hardest to satisfy, but, by the very nature of their
familiarity with the subject, will often be the worst judges of
the likeness. We are all of us, he adds, “very apt to fail in
appreciating the best and noblest parts in the characters of
those whom we know familiarly, for the thousand familiarities
of common life interpose; and it is sad to think that often it is
not until death has hallowed and idealized the character, that
we can do it justice.” Envy and jealousy, remarks David
Hume in treating of the recognition of real genius, have too
much place in a narrow circle, and even familiar acquaintance
with the person of one thus gifted may diminish the applause
due to his performance—that is, among those of his own age
and country. Pindar and Æschylus, we are told, left their
country because those who were born their equals could not
endure to see them rise their superiors. “What a war against
the gods is this!” a heathen admirer is made to exclaim: “it
seems as if it were decreed by a public edict that no one shall
receive from them any gift beyond a certain value; and that if
they do receive it they shall be permitted to return the gods no
thanks for it in their native city.” There are towns so barbarous,
remarks Boccaccio, in Landor’s “Pentameron,” that
they must be informed by strangers of their own great man
when they happen to have produced one; and would then
detract from his merits, that they might not exhibit their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
awkwardness in doing him honour, or their shame in withholding
it.</p>

<p>Charles IX., on a progress through Provence, sent for Nostradamus,
and finding in what slight respect he was held by
his countrymen, made a point of publicly declaring, with right
royal emphasis, that he should take as a slight to himself the
slighting of that philosopher.</p>

<p>In the Journal to Stella, Swift hails with cordiality—for the
Dean could be cordial on occasion—the appreciation in polite
English circles, by ministers and scholars, of Parnell the poet:
“Lord Bolingbroke likes Parnell mightily; and it is pleasant
to see that one who hardly passed for anything in Ireland
makes his way here with a little friendly forwarding.” In
no unlike spirit and style writes Horace Walpole to Marshal
Conway, then travelling abroad: “The honours you have received,
though I have so little taste for such things myself, gave
me great satisfaction; and I do not know whether there is not
more pleasure in <i>not</i> being a prophet in one’s own country,
when one is almost received like Mohammed in every other.
To be an idol at home is no assured touchstone of merit.
Stocks and stones have been adored in fifty regions, but do
not bear transplanting. The Apollo Belvedere and the Hercules
Farnese may lose their temples, but never lose their
estimation, by travelling.” In another letter we have Walpole
exclaiming, “But adieu, retrospect! it is as idle as prophecy,
the characteristic of which is never to be believed where alone
it could be useful, <i>i.e.</i>, in its own country.” And once more, in
a later epistle, commenting on the darksome aspect of the
times: “That the scene grows very serious there is no doubt;
nor do I assume vanity from having possessed the spirit of
prophecy—a most useless talent, as predictions never serve as
warnings. We know prophets are not honoured in their own
country: where then should they be honoured? where they are
not known? where probably they never are heard of?” But
such notes of interrogation might be multiplied <i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>It is to a professedly common-place philosopher we owe the
remark, that while there are families in which there exists a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
preposterous over-estimate of the talents and acquirements of
their several members, there are other families in which there
exists a depressing and unreasonable under-estimate of the
same. He speaks to his knowledge of such a thing as a family
in which certain boys during their early education had it
ceaselessly drilled into them that they were the idlest,
stupidest, and most ignorant boys in the world; which boys
had no sooner gone to a great public school than like rockets
they went up forthwith to the top of their classes, and never
lost their places there, and afterwards at the university distinguished
themselves pre-eminently in honours: “It will not
surprise people who know much of human nature, to be told
that through this brilliant career of school and college work the
home belief in their idleness and ignorance continued unchanged,
and that hardly at its end was the toil-worn senior
wrangler regarded as other than an idle and useless blockhead.”
The writer adds an example of his knowledge of a
successful author—to be identified of course by <i>some</i> readers,
whose relatives never believed, till the reviews assured them of
it, that his writings were anything but “contemptible and discreditable
trash.”</p>

<p>The subject is renewed in the ensuing section, on the text of
a prophet’s non-acceptance in his own country.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PROPHET_IN_HIS_OWN_COUNTRY"><i>THE PROPHET IN HIS OWN COUNTRY.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> iv. 24.</p>

</div>

<p>It was with the emphasis of a “Verily I say unto you,” that
our Lord prefaced the assurance that no prophet is accepted
in his own country. The speaker spoke from bitter
experience. For neither did His brethren believe in Him. It
was when He was come into His own country, and taught in
their synagogues with a wisdom that astonished them, and
wrought mighty works of a kind that bewildered them, that His
own countrymen set about asking if this was not the carpenter’s
son? was not His mother the well-known Mary? were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas, His brethren? and
His sisters, were they not all near at hand, and known as such?
Whence then had this—οὗτος (indefinitely contemptuous)—all
these attributes? And they were offended, scandalized, they
found a stumbling-block in the condition of Him and His. A
double answer was vouchsafed them: the significant restriction
of wonder working, for He did not many mighty works there,
because of their unbelief; and the more direct reply, in so
many words, that a prophet is not without honour, save in his
own country, and in his own house.</p>

<p>Montaigne adverts to this man, or that, having been a
miracle to the world, in whom neither his wife nor his servant
has ever seen anything remarkable: “Few men have been admired
by their own domestics”—a sentence to which point
and popularity have been given by the epigrammatic form of
it, due to Marshal Catinat. “No one,” Montaigne continues,
“has been a prophet, not merely in his own house, but in his
own country, as the experience of history shows. It is the
same in matters of no consequence.... In my country of
Gascony they look upon it as very droll to see me in print.
The farther off I am read from my own home, the better I am
esteemed; I am fain to purchase printers in Guienne,—elsewhere
they purchase me.” Ben Jonson takes note of the
greater reverence paid to things remote or strange to us, than
to much better, if these be nearer, and fall under our sense.
“Men, and almost all sorts of creatures, have their reputation
by distance. Rivers, the farther they run, and more from their
spring, the broader they are, and greater. And where our
original is known, we are the less confident; among strangers
we trust fortune.” Lord Evandale, in Scott’s “Old Mortality,”
discerns at once the “extraordinary qualities” of Henry Morton,
which had escaped the notice of his kinsfolk and friends: “You
have not been long in learning all his extraordinary qualities,
my lord,” says old Major Bellenden. “I, who have known
him from boyhood, could, before this affair, have said much of
his good principles and good nature; but as to his high
talents”—further on <i>that</i> head deponent saith not. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
opinions of relatives as to a man’s power, Dr. Wendell Holmes
declares to be very commonly of little value; not so much because
they sometimes over-rate their own flesh and blood, as
some may suppose; as because, on the contrary, they are quite
as likely to underrate those whom they have grown into the
habit of considering like themselves. <i>Vile habetur quod domi
est</i>, Seneca tersely says.</p>

<p>Edmund Burke, in early life, was not happy at home—there
being none among the household on Arran Quay to sympathise
with his dreams and his aspirations. “He might think
himself a genius,” says one of his many biographers, “but it
was not to be expected that his own relations should yet think
him one.” Describing his position and influence in Lord
Rockingham’s administration, Mr. Macknight observes that it
is, after all, a man’s own relations who generally look with the
least confidence on his long wrestle with adversity, and are
most astonished when the tide turns, and a great victory
succeeds to what had seemed to them a mere hopeless toil.
“To some of the Irish Nagles on the Blackwater, the news that
Edmund had been taken into the confidence of the great Whig
Lord Rockingham, ... must have seemed as extraordinary
as it did to Joseph’s brethren that he should have become so
great a man in hostile Egypt.”</p>

<p><i>Son pays le crut fou</i>, says La Fontaine, of a Greek sage; <i>mais
quoi! aucun n’est prophète chez soi</i>. Of Joan of Arc, and her
early mental struggles, a French historian writes: “It behoves
her to find in the bosom of her family someone who would
believe in her: this was the most difficult part of all.” Non-recognition,
disparagement, cold obstruction. Societies and
families, as Goethe says, behave in the same way to their
dearest members, towns to their worthiest citizens. Consuelo
advising Anzoleto to quit Venice, reminds him that “no person
is a prophet in his own country. This is a bad place for one
who has been seen running about in rags, and where any one
may come to say of you, ‘I was his protector, I saw his hidden
talent, it was I who recommended him and procured his
advance.’” Descartes had to support with philosophic patience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
the scorn of his family, impatient of a philosopher in it.
Jean Bodin, neglected and slighted in his own land, exulted in
the welcome accorded to his books in the English Universities,
which printed as well as prized them: “il n’est pas rare que
nous ayons besoin d’apprendre des étrangers ce que valent nos
compatriotes,” observes M. Léon Feugère.</p>

<p>Every rule has its exceptions, and most proverbs too. The
case of St. Catharine, of Sienna, is cited by a Protestant biographer
as “an exception to the rule that excludes a prophet
from honour in his own country.” The biographer of Edward
Irving, recounting with enthusiasm the details of his reception
in Annandale in 1828, adds that “for once the proverb seems
to have failed. He had honour in his own country, where
gentle and simple flocked to hear him,”—neighbouring ministers
shutting up their kirks on the Sunday when he preached,
and going the “long Sabbath-day’s journey” across the Annandale
moors to hear him, along with their people. La Bruyère
points out on the one side a man recognised by the world at
large as a master-mind, honoured and sought after by eager
admirers, but at home, of no account at all; <i>petit dans son domestique
et aux yeux de ses proches</i>: on the other hand, a man
who is a prophet in his own house and country, who enjoys a
<i>vogue</i> that is confined to his immediate surroundings, and who
<i>s’applaudit d’un mérite rare et singulier qui lui est accordé par la
famille dont il est l’idole</i>. But exceptions to a rule are commonly
taken in confirmation of it; and the rule as to a prophet’s
home acceptance is held to be only confirmed, not disproved,
by here and there a stray example in history to the contrary;
such as Arnold, of Brescia, being rescued from captivity by
some of those partisan nobles of Campania by whom he was
honoured as a prophet: “Tanquam <i>prophetam in terrâ suâ</i> cum
omni honore habebant.” Or, as the experience, highly exceptional,
of young Bernard of Clairvaux, the “strange and irresistible
force” of whose character, as the historian of Latin Christianity
describes it, enthralled his brothers one after another,
and at length his sister. Off to the monastery of Clairvaux they
trooped, a complete monastic brotherhood. The youngest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
boy lingered a short time with his aged father, and then joined
the rest. “Even the father died a monk of Clairvaux in the
arms of Bernard.” But it was not, we are duly reminded, on
his own kindred alone that Bernard wrought with this commanding
power. “When he was to preach, wives hurried
away their husbands, mothers withdrew their sons, friends
their friends, from the resistless magic of his eloquence.” And
those that went—what went they out into the wilderness to
hear? A prophet? Yea, and almost more than a prophet, by
the verdict of his own country and of his father’s house.</p>

<p>We read of those who tempted God in the desert, that
He gave them their request, and sent leanness withal
into their soul. So they did eat meat and were well filled, for
He gave them their own desire; but while their meat was yet
in their mouths, His wrath came upon them and slew the
fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>

<p>A latter-day poetess, almost masculine in genius, as in out-spoken
vigour of diction, tells us that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and sometimes poison in the gift. Well therefore may the
authoress of these lines, which in their original import are
scarcely applicable to our theme, make a distressed soul utter
a petition that certainly is so:—</p>

<p>To Shakspeare for an illustration. Pompey, not the Great,
is anxious for Divine sanction to speed his ambitious resolves
to a prosperous issue. If the great gods be just, he assumes,
they will assist the deeds of justest men,—and therefore himself,
as pre-eminently entitled to that designation. He is impatient,
too, for this manifest favour from above; and sage
Menecrates takes occasion not only to check his impatience in
particular, but to give him a salutary warning on the subject in
general:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">... “We, ignorant of ourselves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Xenophon tells us of Socrates, that when he prayed, his
petition was only this—that the gods would give to him those
things that were good; which he did, forasmuch as they alone
knew what was good for man. “But he who should ask for
gold or silver, or increase of dominion, acted not, in his
opinion, more wisely than one who should pray for the opportunity
to fight, or game, or anything of the like nature; the
consequence of which, being altogether doubtful, might turn,
for aught he knew, not a little to his disadvantage.” For,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent10">... “why, alas! do mortal men in vain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fortune, fate, or Providence complain?</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is a Greek prayer by an unknown poet, but highly commended
by the most illustrious of Socrates’ disciples: that
sovran Jove would grant his subjects good, whether they pray
for it or not; and avert from them evil, even though they pray
for it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ζεῦ βασιλεῦ, τὰ μὲν ἐσθλὰ καὶ εὐχομένοις καὶ ἀνεύκτοις</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ἄμμι δίδου· τὰ δὲ δεινὰ καὶ εὐχομένὀις, ἀπαλέξοις.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And it is to Plato’s dialogue upon prayer that we owe the
instructions imparted by Socrates to Alcibiades, upon which
Addison has founded a paper in the <i>Spectator</i>. In that dialogue
we read how Socrates met Alcibiades going to his devotions,
and observing his eyes to be fixed upon the ground
with great seriousness and attention—for even that fastest of
fast young men could, it seems, be slow enough to say his
prayers—told him that he had reason to be thoughtful upon
that occasion, since it was possible for a man to bring down
evil upon himself by his own supplications, and that those
things which the gods sent him in answer to his petitions
might turn to his destruction. This, says he, may not only
happen when a man prays for what is mischievous in its own
nature, as Œdipus implored the gods to sow dissension between
his sons; but when he prays for what he believes would
be for his good, and against what he believes would be to his
detriment. This the philosopher shows must necessarily
happen among us, since most men are blinded with ignorance,
prejudice, or passion, which hinder them from seeing what
things are really eligible for them. And all this, as his manner
is, the philosopher teaches by examples.</p>

<p>It seems allowed that Juvenal took the cue of his tenth
Satire, as well as Persius of his second, from the Dialogue of
Plato aforesaid.</p>

<p class="noindent">Naples to Pompey a kind fever gave, to hide his honours in a
welcome grave (the poetry of Parson Owen may pardonably
be printed as prose). But public prayers arise: the gods
allow the health requested by the erring vow: by Rome’s and
his cross fate that grave he fled, and lived—to lose his honours
and his head.</p>

<p class="noindent">Juvenal crowds his satire with cases in point, historical and
mythological, political and domestic. The sum of the discourse
is this: that man should allow the higher powers themselves
to determine what may be of advantage to him, and
suitable to his real wants,—he being dearer to them than to
himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Carior est illis homo quàm sibi.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Montaigne bethinks him that a foremost proof of our imbecility
is, that we cannot, by our own wish and desire, find
out what we want. “What plan, how happily soe’er begun,
That, when achieved, we do not wish undone?” And he repeats
the old-world story of King Midas, who prayed to the
gods that all he touched might be turned into gold; and so it
was: his bread became gold, his wine gold, the feathers of his
bed, his under-clothing and his over-coats, gold all: “so that
he found himself overwhelmed with the fruition of his desire,
and endowed with a boon so intolerable, that he was fain to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
unpray his prayers.” In another essay Le Sieur Michel tells how
severely the gods punished the wicked prayers of Œdipus, in
granting them. “He had prayed that his children might
amongst themselves determine the succession to his throne by
arms: and was so miserable as to see himself taken at his word.
We should not pray that all things fall out as our will would
have them, but that our will should subserve what is just and
right.” Owen Feltham records his having observed that what
we either desire or fear doth seldom happen—something we
think not of, for the most part intervening. How infinitely we
should perplex ourselves, he exclaims, if we could obtain whatever
we might wish for! “Do we not often desire that, which
we afterwards see would be our confusion?... Man
could not be more miserable, than if left to choose for himself....
Nothing brings destruction on him sooner, than
when he presumes to part the empire with God.” As Aricie
warns Theseus in the French tragedy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Craignez, seigneur, craignez que le ciel rigoureux</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne vous haïsse assez pour exaucer vos vœux.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And two scenes later Theseus is himself sufficiently of the same
mind to exclaim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ne précipite point tes funestes bienfaits,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neptune! j’aime mieux n’être exaucé jamais.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And afterwards again he utters the tristful line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Inexorables dieux! qui m’avez trop servi.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So in a subsequent passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Je hais jusqu’aux soins dont m’honorent les dieux:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et je m’en vais pleurer leurs faveurs meurtrières,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sans plus les fatiguer d’inutiles prières.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quoi qu’ils fissent pour moi, leur funeste bonté</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne me saurait payer de ce qu’ils m’ont ôté.”</div>
  </div>

<p class="noindent">Madame de Sévigné, in one of her letters to Bussy, moralizes
on the superior wisdom of Heaven’s disposal to man’s proposal;
and adds: “C’est ainsi que nous marchons en aveugles,
ne sachant où nous allons, prenant pour mauvais ce qui est bon,
prenant pour bon ce qui est mauvais, et toujours dans une<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
entière ignorance.” The optative mood of yesterday, a past
tense, is changed in the present tense of to-day for deprecation
and regret.</p>

<p>In one of his many onslaughts against conventionalism, Mr.
Emerson says that what we ask daily is to be conventional.
“Supply, most kind gods! this defect in my dress, in my form,
in my fortunes, which puts me a little out of the ring; supply
it, and let me be like the rest whom I admire, and on good
terms with them.” But the wise gods, according to this essayist,
reply, “No, we have better things for thee. By humiliations,
by defeats, by loss of sympathy, by gulfs of disparity, learn a
wider truth and humanity than that of a fine gentleman,”—a
Fifth-Avenue landlord, or a West-End householder, not being
Mr. Emerson’s ideal of the highest style of man. Æsop, Saadi,
Cervantes, Regnard, he adds, have been taken by corsairs, left
for dead, sold for slaves, and know the realities of human life.—With
Mr. Carlyle, we will not complain, therefore, of Dante’s
miseries; who, had all gone right with him, as he wished it,
might have been Prior, Podestà, or whatsoever they call it, of
Florence, well accepted among neighbours,—in which case,
the world had wanted one of the most notable works ever
spoken or sung. “Florence would have had another prosperous
Lord Mayor; and the ten dumb centuries continued
voiceless, and the ten other listening centuries (for there will
be ten of them and more) had no <i>Divina Comedia</i> to hear!
We will complain of nothing. A nobler destiny was appointed
for this Dante; and he, struggling like a man towards death
and crucifixion, could not help fulfilling it. Give <i>him</i> the
choice of his happiness! He knew not, more than we do,
what was really happy, what was really miserable.”</p>

<p>Visions, and hopes, and prospects, writes Horace Walpole,
are pretty playthings for boys. “It is folly to vex one’s self
for what cannot last very long. Indeed, what can, even when
one is young? Corydon firmly believes he shall be wretched
for ever if he does not marry Phyllis. That misery can but
last till she has lost her bloom. His eternal woe would vanish
if her nose grew red. How often do our griefs become our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
comforts! I know what I wish to-day; not at all what I shall
wish to-morrow. Sixty says, You did not wish for <i>me</i>, yet you
would like to keep me. Sixty is in the right; and I have not a
word more to say.” The Strawberry Hill esquire was himself
turning the shady side of sixty when he thus wrote. Of quite
another school was that gentle and good Q. Q., as she styled
herself, once popular, now almost forgotten, who thus moralized
her song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How false is found, as on in life we go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our early estimate of bliss or woe!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">—Some sparkling joy attracts us, that we fain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would sell a precious birthright to obtain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There all our hopes of happiness are placed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life looks without it like a joyless waste;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No good is prized, no comfort sought beside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prayers, tears implore, and will not be denied:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven pitying hears th’ intemperate, rude appeal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And suits its answer to our truest weal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The self-sought idol, if at last bestow’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proves, what our wilfulness required—a goad.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne’er, but as needful chastisement, is given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wish thus forced and torn and storm’d from Heaven;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if withheld, in pity, from our prayer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We rave, awhile, of torment and despair....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime, Heaven bears the grievous wrong, and waits</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In patient pity till the storm abates ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deigning, perhaps, to show the mourner soon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas special mercy that denied the boon.”</div>

<p>Chateaubriand’s most sentimental of melancholy-mad heroes,
overwhelmed, as he flatters himself, with imaginary sufferings,
offers up a prayer for some real calamity to overtake him; and,
to his cost, is taken at his word. “Dans mon délire, j’avais
été jusqu’à désirer d’éprouver un malheur, pour avoir du moins
un objet réel de souffrance: épouvantable souhait, que Dieu
dans sa colère, a trop exaucé!” It is but the Christian (yet
not too Christian) expression of the old pagan poet’s gloomy
verse: <i>magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis</i>.</p>

<p>There is a sonnet of Filicaja’s, of which a good deal is made
by Richardson in his History of Sir Charles Grandison,—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
concluding lines being an impressive vindication of the ways of
Providence to man: <i>Provvidenza alta infinita</i>, if it sometimes
denies the favours we implore, denies in kindness; and seeming
to deny a blessing, grants one in that very refusal: <i>o negar
finge, e nel negar concede</i>.</p>

<p>William Collins the painter—a loving and lovable man as
well as refined artist—in one of his letters home expresses his
“decided opinion, that if the Almighty were to give us everything
for which we feel desirous, we should as often find it
necessary to pray to Him to take away as to grant new
favours.” And he refers to thousands of cases that he could
bring forward in proof of his assertion.</p>

<p>It amounts to a sort of refrain in the melodious rhythm of
that fragmentary prose-poem of De Quincey’s, “The Daughter
of Lebanon,”—the admonition of the prophet to the lovely
woman in the Damascus market-place: “Ask what thou wilt—great
or small—and through me thou shalt receive it from God.
But, my child, ask not amiss. For God is able out of thy own
evil asking to weave snares for thy footing. And oftentimes
to the lambs whom He loves, He gives by seeming to refuse;
gives in some better sense, or” (and here the prophet’s voice
swelled into the power of anthems) “in some far happier
world.” And when the sun is declining to the west on the
thirtieth day, the prophet iterates the strain of old: “Lady of
Lebanon, the day is already come, and the hour is coming, in
which my covenant must be fulfilled with thee. Wilt thou,
therefore, being now wiser in thy thoughts, suffer God, thy new
Father, to give by seeming to refuse; to give in some better
sense, or in some far happier world?” But the daughter of
Lebanon sorrowed at these words; she yearned after her native
hills, and the sweet twin-born sister with whom from infant
days hand-in-hand she had wandered amongst the everlasting
cedars. The delirium of fever, and approaching death, are
next described; and again the evangelist sits down by her
bedside, and rebukes the clouds that trouble her vision, and
bids them stand no more between that dying Magdalen and
the forests of Lebanon. Anon, we read how the blue sky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
parted to the right and to the left, laying bare the infinite
revelations that can be made visible only to dying eyes; and
how, as the child of Lebanon gazed upon the mighty visions,
she saw bending forward from the heavenly host, as if in
gratulation to herself, the one countenance for which she
hungered and thirsted. “The twin-sister, that should have
waited for her in Lebanon, had died of grief, and was waiting
for her in Paradise. Immediately in rapture she soared
upwards from her couch; immediately in weakness she fell
back; and being caught by the evangelist, she flung her arms
around his neck; whilst he breathed into her ear his final
whisper, ‘Wilt thou now suffer that God should give by seeming
to refuse?’—‘Oh yes—yes—yes,’ was the fervent answer
from the daughter of Lebanon.” Hitherto she had known not
what to ask for as she ought. Hitherto her asking had been
amiss: she had asked for she knew not what. But now her
vision was purged. Now she had the second-sight that could
pierce through and beyond the night-side of nature, and gaze
on the land that is very far off. Hitherto she had, at the best,
seen through a glass darkly; but now, it might be said, face to
face. So that she knew what to ask for, now.</p>

<p>Chactas, the blind old sachem in Chateaubriand’s Wertherian
romance, is made to bring that once enthusiastically admired
story to an end by relating a parable to his woe-fraught young
listener. It tells how the Meschacebé, soon after leaving its
source among the hills, began to feel weary of being a simple
brook; and so asked for snows from the mountains, water
from the torrents, rain from the tempests; until, its petitions
granted, it burst its bounds, and ravaged its hitherto delightsome
banks. At first the proud stream exulted in its force; but
seeing ere long that it carried desolation in its flow, that its
progress was now doomed to solitude, and that its waters were
for ever turbid, it came to regret the humble bed hollowed out
for it by nature,—the birds, the flowers, the trees, and the
brooks, hitherto the modest companions of its tranquil course.</p>

<p>The moral of the myth of Tithonus is one for all time. Mr.
Tennyson has pointed it for ours. He shows us in Tithonus a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>

spaces of the East; and from this grey shadow, once a man,

of Genesis how that all the days that Adam lived were nine
hundred and thirty years, and he died; and all the days of
Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died; and all
the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty nine
years, and he died;—immediately shut himself up in a convent,
an absolute recluse from the world, as not thinking anything
in this life worth pursuing, which had not regard to another.</p>

<p>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?</p>

<p class="noindent">So writes Mrs. Browning. And thus writes Barry Cornwall,
on the same trite text; it is the last stanza of the History of a
Life, and of a successful one:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And then—he died. Behold before ye</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again, in the same poet’s chanson of the time of Charlemagne,
the stanza that magnifies that hero-king, and tells how
he fought and vanquished Lombard, Saxon, Saracen, and ruled
every race he conquered with a deep consummate skill—is
followed by one beginning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p class="noindent">And once again, in one of this author’s dramatic fragments is
sketched the career of what Mr. Carlyle would call a “foiled
potentiality”—of one who, in favourable circumstances, might
have been, but who in prosaic reality and the matter-of-fact
pressure of this work-a-day world, never actually became, great.

<p>Death stands everywhere in the background, as the elder
Schlegel says in his analysis of the elements of tragic poetry,
and to it every well or ill-spent moment brings us nearer and
closer; and even when a man has been so singularly fortunate
as to reach the utmost term of life without any grievous
calamity, the inevitable doom still awaits him to leave or to be
left by all that is most dear to him on earth. In the words,
most musical, most melancholy, of the laureate,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,</div>

<p>Addison, in another essay than that already referred to,
describes an afternoon he passed in Westminster Abbey,
straying through and lingering in the churchyard, the cloisters,
and the church, “amusing himself,” as the phrase then ran—not
quite in our frivolous sense—with the tombstones and the
inscriptions that he met with in those several regions of the
dead, most of which recorded nothing else of the buried
person, but that he was born upon one day, and died upon
another; the whole history of his life being comprehended in
those two circumstances that are common to all mankind.
The “Spectator” could not but look upon these registers
of existence, whether of brass or marble, as a kind of satire
upon the departed persons, who had left no other memorial of
them but that they were born, and that they died. Mr. de
Quincey characteristically opened his autobiographic sketches
in their original form, with the avowal that nothing makes
such dreary and monotonous reading as the old hackneyed
roll-call, chronologically arranged, of inevitable facts in a
man’s life. “One is so certain of the man’s having been born,
and also of his having died, that it is dismal to be under the
necessity of reading it.” The man—a man—any man—every
man. It is the common lot. And we know what James
Montgomery has made of the Common Lot. Here are two or
three of the stanzas that are most to the purpose:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Once in the flight of ages past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There lived a man: and who was he?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mortal! howe’er thy lot be cast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That man resembled thee.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And foes,—his foes are dead.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Than this,—<span class="smcap">There lived a Man!</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There lived a man—lived, and loved, and learned, and
laboured—enjoyed the common joys of his kind, endured the
common sufferings. <span class="smcap">And he died.</span> Old Egeus mooted a
veritable truism when moralizing thus, in Chaucer:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yit ither ne lyvede never man, he seyde,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In al this world, that some tyme he ne deyde.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A French historian comments on this characteristic of old
cloister chronicles, that the obscurest event of the cloister
holds in them as conspicuous a place as the greatest revolutions
in history. For instance, in a chronicle cited by him of
the year of grace 732, which produced the battle of Poictiers,
whereby Charles Martel arrested the vast invasion of Islamism,
not a line is vouchsafed to that event. In fact, the year is
passed over without notice, as containing nothing really
deserving of notice. But beside a date expressly given, we
read, “Martin est mort,”—Martin being an unknown monk of
the Abbey of Corvey; and, farther on again, “Charles, maire
du palais, est mort.” Martin was an unknown monk, and he
died. Charles Martel was mayor of the palace, and the conqueror
at Poictiers, and he died. Well remarks M. Demogeot,
that “tous les hommes deviennent egaux devant la secheresse
laconique de ces premiers chroniqueurs.” “We must all go,
that is certain,” writes Mrs. Piozzi to Sir James Fellows, “and
’tis the only thing that <i>is</i> certain. Καὶ ἀπεθανε ends all the cases
Dr. James quotes from your old friend Hippocrates.” All the
physician’s cases have the same terminal affix, <span class="smcap">And he died</span>.
Very long-lived some of them may be; but, as Mr. Browning
puts it in his fine poem of “Saul,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But the licence of age has its limit; thou diest at last.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>We are told of St. Anschar, whose missionary career in
Sweden is commemorated in Milman’s “Latin Christianity,”
that the ardour of youth had begun to relax his strict austerity
of monastic discipline, when all at once the world was startled
by the tidings of Charlemagne’s death. That the mighty sovran
of so many kingdoms must suffer the common lot, struck young
Anschar as something beyond the common; and from that hour
he lived in the world as not of it, and bore on his way through
it as verily a stranger and a pilgrim upon earth, with serious
work to do, but working in and walking by faith, not sight.</p>

<p>Marcus Antoninus, in his self-communings, bids himself consider
how many physicians are dead that used to value themselves
upon the cure of their patients, and how many astrologers
who thought themselves great men by foretelling the deaths of
others; how many warriors, who had knocked out the brains of
thousands upon thousands; and how many tyrants who managed
the power of life and death with as much rigour as if they had
been themselves immortal.</p>

<p>Among the pointed sayings that have been thought worthy of
preservation—by Gibbon, for example—of Hormisdas, a fugitive
prince of Persia, who was at Rome in the fourth century, is
this,—“that one thing only had displeased him, to find that
men died at Rome as well as elsewhere.” Courtiers have
avowed themselves shocked at the non-exception of royalty from
the universal doom. A courtly preacher, who had announced
the unconditional fact that we are all mortal, is said to have
checked himself, on remembering that royalty was present, and
to have qualified the assertion by the circumspect salvo, “At
least, nearly all.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Lewis the Eleventh was too shrewd a man
to give heed to such courtly suggestions; otherwise, if ever
there were prince that would fain have believed the fiction, it
was he, so abhorrent to his shuddering nature was the imagination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
of his own decease. And Commines relates how physicians
combined their remedies with the sacred objects produced from
the sanctuary to avert the dread decree, “pour lui allonger la
vie. Toutefois le tout n’y fasoit rien; et falloit qu’il passât par
là où les autres ont passés.” And he died. All stories have
the same ending.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“The Frenchman first in literary fame;</div>

<p>That very old poet, Stephen Hawes, for discovering in whom
“one fine line,” Warton was called “the indulgent historian of
our poetry,” tells his own life-story quite to an end, including
the particulars of his funeral and epitaph. A finer critic than
Warton, or than Warton’s critic, bids those who smile at the
design dismiss their levity before the poet’s utterance:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>What—asks the most meditative of Roman emperors, in his
Meditations, discussing with himself the ultimate fate, often reluctantly
undergone, of certain long-lived persons—what are
they more than those who went off in their infancy? What is
become of Cæcilianus, Fabius, Julianus, and Lepidus? Their
heads are all laid somewhere. They buried a great many;
but at last they came to be buried themselves. Mr. Dickens, as
well as Hervey, has his meditations among the tombs,—and
these are of them in the little hemmed-in churchyards of the
city—these, over an old tree at the church window, with no room
for its branches, that has seen out generation after generation
of civic worthies: “So with the tomb of the old Master of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Company, on which it drips. His son restored it, and died;
his daughter restored it, and died; and then he had been
remembered long enough, and the tree took possession of him,
and his name cracked out.” To quote Chaucer again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That is to seyn, in youthe or elles in age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He moot ben deed, the kyng as schal a page.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cranmer’s transported prevision, in Shakspeare, of the grand
future that awaited the infant princess Elizabeth, is dashed with
sadness towards the end—the strain subsiding into a minor
key—by the unwelcome but inevitable reflection, “But she
must die.” So muses and moralises Talbot again, in another of
the historical plays:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But kings and mightiest potentates must die;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For that’s the end of human misery.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Warwick, in another of them, finding that, of all his
lands, is nothing left him but his body’s length, exclaims, as
one that at last feels it feelingly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, live we how we can, yet die we must.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And once more in yet another of them, when King John dies,
and Salisbury witnessing the death, exclaims, “But now a king—now
thus!” the prince who is to succeed takes home the
lesson to himself, and confesses, in diction borrowed from the
mere machinery of clockwork,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Even so must I run on, and even so stop.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In exhibiting to Odysseus in the shades below a group of the
fairest and most famous of women, Homer has been supposed
by some of his commentators to have designed a lecture on
mortality to the whole sex. Tertullian’s trumpet is blown with
no uncertain sound when <i>he</i> thus addresses the frivolous fair of
his day: “I have said, ye are gods, and ye are all the children
of the Most High.... But, O gods of flesh and blood,
O gods of earth and dust, ye shall die like men, and all your
glory shall fall to the ground, <i>veruntamen sicut homines
moriemini</i>.” This is in Tertullian’s description of the vain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
prodigal and exacting beauty. Suggestive in its way is an
anecdote related by Mrs. Thrale about Sir Joshua Reynolds’s
picture of two fashionable belles, Mrs. Crewe and Mrs.
Bouverie, attired as two shepherdesses, and with this motto
attached, <i>Et in Arcadiâ ego</i>. What could that mean? is Dr.
Johnson said to have asked. Reynolds replied that the king
could have told him: “<i>He</i> saw it yesterday, and said at once,
‘Oh, there is a tombstone in the background. Ay, ay, death is
even in Arcadia.’” The thought is said to have been borrowed
from Poussin—where some gay revellers stumble over a death’s
head, with a scroll proceeding from its mouth, saying, Et in
Arcadiâ <i>ego</i>.</p>

<p>Memorable at Saladin’s banquet to Richard and his peers—ever
memorable among the banners and pennons, the trophies
of battles won and kingdoms overthrown, is the long lance displaying
a shroud, “the banner of Death, with this impressive
inscription—‘Saladin, King of Kings—Saladin, Victor of
Victors—Saladin must Die.’”</p>

<p>Poet Prior laments with courtly distress the inflexible fact
that the British monarch, to whom he is addressing his <i>carmen
seculare</i> for the year of grace MDCC., must go the way of all
flesh:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But a relentless destiny</div>

<p>For as Master Matthew puts it in another ode:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The truism appears to have been a favourite theme with
Prior, who expatiates upon it in a variety of keys. Here is one
other specimen from his stores, in octosyllabic metre:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All must obey the general doom,</div>

</div>

<p>Does not Cervantes begin the last chapter of his great work
with the reflection that, as all human things, especially the lives
of men, are transitory, ever advancing to their decline and final
termination, so “Don Quixote was favoured by no privilege
of exemption from the common fate,” for the period of his
dissolution came when he least thought of it—and he died.</p>

<p>Death’s final conquest is the subject of a fine poem of James
Shirley’s; the piece by which he is, in every sense, best remembered.
How death lays his icy hands on kings, is there
told with pitiless candour; and the merry monarch, <i>par excellence</i>,
Charles the Second, is said to have greatly admired the
poetry, if not the candour, of Shirley’s strain. Early or late, all
stoop to fate; that is the trite topic. But the moral is noble,
and nobly expressed. The poet reminds laurelled victors that
the garlands are withering on their brow, and that soon upon
death’s purple altar shall the “victor victim” bleed:—</p>

<p>To have written it ultra-Protestant, would mislead into an
expectation of polemical matter, offensive to Orangeism,
and entirely alien from the purpose. For who is the hyper-protester,
not to write it ultra-Protestant, of whom we speak?
None other than St. Peter. Nominally the first Pope. But
let that pass. Whether technically an ultra-Protestant or not,—let
that pass too. It is with his surplusage of protestations,
vehemently asserted, and anon ignominiously ignored, that we
are at present concerned. Though all men, all, should be
offended because of Christ, should stumble and fall because of
Him, yet would he never be offended, never stumble, never
lose his footing, firm as a rock, firm as his own name, Peter,
Cephas; a rock on which the Church was to be built. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
protest of the apostle won no meed of thanks and assurance of
conviction from his Lord. He who needed not that any
should testify of man, for He knew what was in man—and
knew what was wanting in <i>this</i> man,—waved aside, as absolutely
worthless, the perfervid protestations of the impulsive son of
Jonas. Thrice should Peter deny Him before dawn of another
day. Deny Him? Had it come to that? The protester must
become ultra in his protests. “Though I should die with Thee,
yet will I not deny Thee!” It would be beside the mark here
to take into account the other <i>voces et præterea nihil</i>, echoing
the same thing—protested notes at the best—for likewise
also said all the disciples. Peter is their representative man,
and ours.</p>

<p>Gertrude’s comment in “Hamlet,” on the accumulated asseverations
of the stage-queen, “The lady doth protest too
much, methinks,” has passed into a proverb. “The more
vehemently they assert, the less credit they obtain for sincerity,”
observes Hartley Coleridge, of some examples of impulsive
womankind. Racine’s Bérénice turns the tables on Titus in
this regard, when she tells him,</p>

<p>How fulsome and hollow, exclaims Marcus Antoninus, does
that man look who cries, “I’m resolved to deal clearly with
you.” Hark you, friend, the philosophic emperor addresses
him, “what need of all this flourish? let your actions speak.”
Mr. Disraeli, in his earliest book, has an eloquent paragraph
on “that eagerness of protestation which,” in the man charged
with criminality, “is a sure sign of crime.” There is as much
of overacting one’s part on the great stage of life, as on the
mimic boards; and that with graver issues and a drearier fate.</p>

<p class="tb">When the subtle and ambitious John of Gischala, pursuing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
his own dark course, as it is traced in the “History of the
Jews,” joined outwardly the party of Ananus, and was active
beyond others in council and camp, he yet kept up a secret correspondence
with the Zealots, to whom he betrayed all the movements
of the assailants. “To conceal this secret he redoubled
his assiduities, and became so extravagant in his protestations
of fidelity to Ananus and his party, that he completely over-acted
his part, and incurred suspicion.” His intended dupes
began gradually, and none too soon, to look with a jealous eye
on their too obsequious, most obedient, and most devoted
servant.</p>

<p>Describing the ten dreary years during which (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1198-1208),
with but short intervals of truce, Germany was abandoned
to all the horrors of civil war, Dean Milman observes
that “the repeated protestations” of Pope Innocent III., that
<i>he</i> was not the cause of these fatal discords, betray the fact that
he was accused of the guilt, and that he had to wrestle with
his own conscience to acquit himself of the charge. Sir Thomas

<p>Hawthorne remarks that Italian asseverations of any questionable
fact, though uttered with rare earnestness of manner, never
vouch for themselves as coming from any depth, like roots
drawn out of the substance of the soul, with some of the soil
clinging to them. Their energy expends itself in exclamation.
The vaulting ambition of their hyperboles overleaps itself, and
falls on the other side. Swift refers to oaths in the mouth of a
gamester, as ever most used as their truth is most questioned.</p>

<p>That scapegrace guardian of George Canning’s boyhood, Mr.
Reddish, is said to have been significantly fond, on quite trivial
occasions, of making affidavits,—“the refuge of base and vulgar
minds,” Robert Bell calls them,—as if he, Reddish, felt that
his word was not to be believed. Cowper is caustic in his
application of St. Paul’s statement, that oaths terminate all

infers, in lines that go on to tell how</p>

<p>The imprecation of Corneille’s Dorante, <i>Que le foudre à vos
yeux m’écrase si je mens!</i> only evokes from Clarice the contemptuous
rebuff, <i>Un menteur</i> [which, and more than which, emphatically,
Dorante is, for he is <i>Le Menteur</i>,] <i>est toujours prodigue
de serments</i>. So again Racine’s Theseus: <i>Toujours les scélérats
ont recours au parjure</i>,—when Hippolytus begins to call heaven,
and earth, and universal nature to witness, etc. So, too,
Chamont, in Otway’s tragedy: “When a man talks of love,
with caution trust him; but if he swears, he’ll certainly deceive
thee.” Indeed, as Owen Feltham has it, wherever there
is too much profession, there is cause for suspicion. “Reality
cares not to be tricked out with too taking an outside; and
deceit, when she intends to cozen, studies disguise. Least of
all should we be taken with swearing asseverations. Truth
needs not the varnish of an oath to make her plainness
credited.” Fielding’s Pettifogger, on a certain occasion, calling
to mind that he had not been sworn, as he usually was, before
he gave his evidence, “now bound what he had declared with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
so many oaths and imprecations, that the landlady’s ears were
shocked, and she put a stop to his swearing, by assuring him of
her belief,” inconsiderately enough, as the manner of the man
might have proved. Scott’s Jorworth, when heaping asseveration
on asseveration, is cut short by the honest Fleming he is
striving to mislead: “Stop, good Jorworth; thou heapest thine
oaths too thickly on each other, for me to value them to the
right estimate; that which is so lightly pledged, is sometimes
thought not worth redeeming.” So again Monkbarns tells the
gaberlunzie, after hearing his story of the adept, “I am strongly
disposed to believe that you have spoken the truth, the rather,
that you have not made any of those obtestations of the superior
powers, which I observe you and your comrades always make
use of when you mean to deceive folks.” The author of
“London Labour and the London Poor,” recounts the redundance
of “Glory be to God! it’s the thruth I’m telling of
you, sir,” etc., etc.; which he had to hear from Irish mendicity,
or mendacity, or both. “The dignity of truth is lost with
much protesting,” the Cicero of Jonson’s “Catiline” says.</p>

<p>Take up any ordinary history, and you are but too sure to
come across examples enough and to spare, of people who did
protest too much, and did not keep their word. Glance at
Alison’s big book, and on one page you read, of Napper
Tandy, for instance, “But the conduct of this leader was far
from keeping pace with these vehement protestations; for no
sooner did he hear of the reverse sustained by the French
corps which had landed in Killala Bay, than he re-embarked
on board the French brig <i>Anacreon</i>, and got safe across the
channel.” On another we have Tippoo Saib striving to disarm
the suspicions of the British Government by “professions of
eternal gratitude and attachment,” and considerably overacting
his part. On another we have Napoleon bidding Marmont
“spare no protestations of assistance to Turkey;” and himself
assuring the Turkish ambassador that, “his right hand was not
more inseparable from his left, than the Sultan Selim should
ever be to him;” in consequence of which protestations, Turkey
threw herself into the breach against both Russia and England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
only to find the imperial ultra-protester, within one little
month from the protestations, arranging for the immediate
partition, with the Czar, of the Turkish dominions. Look,
again, at Benjamin Constant, launching his vehement philippic
against Napoleon, in the <i>Journal des Débats</i> on the eve of
the Emperor’s return from Elba, and declaring, “Never will I
crawl, like a base deserter from power to power. Under
Louis XVIII. we enjoy a representative government. Under
Bonaparte we endured a government of Mamelukes. He is an
Attila, a Gengis Khan!” And then we read how, a few days
after this fulmination, Constant, the <i>in</i>constant, became a
councillor of state under this Attila, an active supporter of this
Gengis Khan. Another ground of indictment against Napoleon
is found by Alison in the eagerness of his protestations to
Russia, that he had no way connived at the election of Bernadotte
to the throne of Sweden, when next vacant. “The extreme
anxiety which Napoleon evinced for some time afterwards
to convince the court of St. Petersburg that he had
taken no concern in this election, only renders it the more
probable that he was in reality at the bottom of the transaction.”
The asseverations commenced by the younger Pennyboy,
in Jonson’s “Staple of News,” are declined and dismissed, by
the elder, who knows their worth, with this summary and suggestive
caution:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FLEETING_SHADOWS"><i>FLEETING SHADOWS.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Job</span> xiv. 2.</p>

</div>

<p>As man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of
trouble; as he is said to come forth like a flower, only to
be cut down, so is it further said of him, that “he fleeth also
as a shadow, and continueth not.” His days are like a shadow
that declineth. He himself is gone as a shadow that fleeteth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
away. For man is vanity, his days are as a shadow, saith the
psalmist. And the preacher, whose text is vanity of vanities,
all is vanity, finds vexation of spirit in meditations on man, all
the days of whose vain life he spendeth as a shadow.</p>

<p><i>What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue!</i> The
exclamation was that of a great statesman, amid the excitement
and the contests of public life, when there reached him news
of the sudden death of a fellow-candidate and colleague.
Shadow-hunted shadows. The pursued and the pursuers—the
game and the sportsmen—shadows all. Burke’s exclamation
was often in the mind of the late Sir James Graham, and,
towards the close of his life, not unfrequently on his lips.</p>

<p><i>O curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane!</i> Men
were ever of old, and they are found to be now, the willing
victims of illusion in all stages of life: children, youths, adults,
and old men, all, as Emerson puts it, are led by one bauble or
another. “There are as many pillows of illusion as flakes in a
snow-storm. We wake from one dream into another dream.
The toys, to be sure, are various, and are graduated in refinement
to the quality of the dupe.” For instance, the intellectual
man requires a fine bait, while the sots are easily
amused. “But everybody is drugged with his own frenzy, and
the pageant marches at all hours, with music and banner and
badge.” Shadows before, and shadows behind, and all fleeting.
False glozing pleasures, to adopt George Herbert’s
diction, are the shadowy lure,</p>

<p>Marcus Antoninus, in his “Meditations,” harps on the note
of shadow-hunting or shadow-hunted shadows. You will soon
be reduced to ashes and a skeleton, he keeps telling himself;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
and even if you leave a name,—what is a name? what is in a
name? <i>Vox et præterea nihil.</i> The shadows you, a shade,
pursue, are miserably shadowy. The prizes of life are, he
says, so paltry, that to scuffle for them is ridiculous, and puts
him in mind of a set of puppies snarling for a bone, or of the
contests of children for a toy. Wherever he looks, the wide
world over, and in whatever age of its history, he sees abundance
of people very busy, and big with their projects, who
presently drop off, and moulder to dust and ashes. The
freshest laurels wither apace, and the echoes of Fame are soon
silenced. The “insect youth” that people the air and make
it murmurous with busy life,—is not their close resemblance to
the children of men one of poetry’s common-places?</p>

<p>Having asked to be told her fortune by the Wise Wight of
Mucklestane Moor, Miss Ildeston, in Scott’s story, is told by
the cynical recluse, that it is a simple one; an endless chase
through life after follies not worth catching, and when caught,
successively thrown away—a chase, pursued from the days of
tottering infancy to those of old age upon his crutches.
“Toys and merry-making in childhood—love and its absurdities
in youth—spadille and basto in age, shall succeed each
other as objects of pursuit: flowers and butterflies in spring,—butterflies
and thistledown in summer,—withered leaves in
autumn and winter—all pursued, all caught, all flung aside.”
<i>Que vont elles faire de si grand matin</i>, Cleopas asks his demon-guide,
concerning <i>ces personnes</i> whose early rising and eager
bustle have caught and fixed his attention. “Ce que vous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
souhaitez de savoir, reprit le Démon, est une chose digne
d’être observée. Vous allez voir un tableau des soins, des
mouvements, des peines que les pauvres mortels se donnent
pendant cette vie, pour remplir, le plus agréablement qu’il
leur est possible, ce petit éspace qui est entre leur naissance et

<p>There is much that is suggestive in the Abbé Gerbet’s
discoursings in the Catacombs at Rome. “Ce dernier calque
de l’homme,” he says, in what has been called a commentary
on Bossuet’s <i>mot</i>, that the corpse of a man becomes a <i>je ne sais
quoi</i>, for which there is no name in any language—“cette
forme si vague, si effacée, à peine empreinte sur une poussière
à peu près impalpable, volatile, presque transparente, d’un
blanc mat et incertain, est ce qui donne le mieux quelque idée
de ce que les anciens appelaient une <i>ombre</i>. Cette forme est
plus frêle que l’aile d’un papillon, plus prompte à s’evanouir
que la goutte de rosée suspendue à un brin d’herbe au soleil;
un peu d’air agité par votre main, un souffle, un son deviennent
ici des agents puissants qui peuvent anéantir en une seconde
ce que dix-sept siècles, peut-être, de destruction ont épargné.
Voyez,—vous venez de respirer, et la forme a disparu. Voilà la
fin de l’histoire de l’homme en ce monde.” What shadows we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>

<p>Hawthorne’s Gervayse Hastings is a type and symbol, when
he describes himself as depressed by a haunting perception of
unreality; as one to whom all things, all persons, are like
shadows flickering on the wall. “Neither have I myself any
real existence,” he says, “but am a shadow like the rest.” And
the end—not to say the moral—of his story may serve to remind
us of the Abbé Gerbet’s words. Gervayse Hastings is
seated with other guests at a feast—of very odd fellows—over
whom is suspended the skeleton of the oddest of all, the
founder of the feast. As the speaker ceased his confession of
shadowy experiences, “it so chanced that at this juncture the
decayed ligaments of the skeleton gave way, and the dry bones
fell together in a heap.... The attention of the company
being thus diverted for a single instant from Gervayse Hastings,
they perceived on turning again towards him, that the
old man had undergone a change. His shadow had ceased
to flicker on the wall.” The woe of this old man was, that to
him the world to come was all shadow too.</p>

<p>Mrs. Schimmelpenninck expresses her belief that in youth
and middle age there is often a real conviction of the transitory
nature of the most established temporal things, but that in old
age it is not merely a conviction, but a vivid palpable reality,
and that the eternal mountains do then indeed appear near at
hand; while all the campaign around seems faded into shadowy
distance; and she inclines to say, like the monk, who for forty
years had exhibited the picture of the Last Supper, that he had
seen so many pass away, that himself and those he spoke to
seemed a shadow, while the blessed institution of the Holy
Supper stood before him alone a reality. But many are the
young hearts that feel as Margaret Hale felt, in Mrs. Gaskell’s
story, when to her life seemed a vain show, so unsubstantial,
and flickering, and fleeting, and when “it was as if from some
aërial belfry, high up above the stir and jar of the earth, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
was a bell continually tolling, ‘All are shadows!—all are passing!—all
is past!’”</p>

<p><i>Le tems même sera detruit</i>, as La Bruyère says: “ce n’est
qu’un point dans les espaces immenses de l’éternité, et il sera
effacé. Il y a de légères et frivoles circonstances du tems, qui
ne sont pas stables, qui passent, et que j’appelle des modes, la
grandeur, la faveur, les richesses, la puissance, l’autorité, l’indépendance,
le plaisir, les joies, la superfluité. Que deviendront
ces modes, quand le tems même aura disparu? La vertu seule,
si peu à la mode, va au-delà des tems.”</p>

<p class="noindent">So writes Byron in the poem that contains perhaps his grandest
and most powerful strains, interspersed among his wittiest and
most wicked ones. If ever man was haunted by the conviction
that we are shadows all, and that shadows are our pursuit, it
was he. But with him there was nothing of a “saving faith” in
this. As Shakspeare’s Prince of Arragon reads on the scroll at

Croaker in the comedy pronounce life to be, at the greatest and

little till it falls asleep, and then all the care is over; while
Honeywood assents—Good-natured Man that he is—with a

<p>Shadow-hunted shadows is the very text for Mr. Carlyle.
World’s memory is very whimsical now and then, he says, in
recording the forgotten exploits of Johann, King of Bohemia,
“all which have proved voiceless in the World’s memory; while
the casual Shadow of a Feather he once more has proved vocal
there.” And a whole chapter is devoted to, and entitled, a
Kaiser hunting Shadows,—Kaiser Karl with his Pragmatic
Sanction to wit, and similar projects, aims, or hobbies, more or
less shadowy and unsubstantial, all. “There was another vast
Shadow, or confused high-piled continent of shadows, to which
our poor Kaiser held with his customary tenacity. To procure
adherences and assurances to this dear Pragmatic Sanction,
was even more than the shadow of the Spanish crown,” the one
grand business of his life henceforth. “Shadow of Pragmatic
Sanction, shadow of the Spanish crown,—it was such shadow-huntings
of the Kaiser in Vienna” that thwarted the Prussian
Double-marriage. Another object which Kaiser Karl pursued
with some diligence, and which “likewise proved a shadow,”
was his Ostend East India Company, which gave much disturbance
to mankind. “This was the third grand shadow which the
Kaiser chased, shaking all the world, poor crank world, as he
strode after it.” Foiled in this, as in another and another chase,
no wonder he grew more and more saturnine, and “addicted
to solid taciturn field-sports. His Political ‘Perforce Hunt
(<i>Parforce Jagd</i>),’ with so many two-footed terriers, and legationary
beagles, distressing all the world by their baying and
their burrowing, had proved to be of Shadows; and melted
into thin air, to a very singular degree!” Many chapters later
Mr. Carlyle recurs to his picture of the “Kaiser in his Shadow-hunt,
coursing the Pragmatic Sanction chiefly, as he has done
these twenty years past”—and so begins a chapter entitled, by
a mixed metaphor, “Kaiser’s Shadow-hunt has caught Fire”—by
contact, namely, with inflammable Poland. And a subsequent
chapter details the damages the poor Kaiser had to pay
for meddling in Polish elections,—“for galloping thither in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
chase of Shadows.... This may be considered as the
consummation of the Kaiser’s Shadow-hunt; or at least its
igniting and exploding point.... Shadow-hunt is now
all gone to Pragmatic Sanction, as it were: that is now the one
thing left in Nature for a Kaiser; and that he will love, and
chase, as the summary of all things.” From this point we see
him go steadily down, and at a rapid rate,—getting into disastrous
Turkish wars, “with as little preparation for War or Fact
as a life-long Hunt of <i>Shadows</i> presupposes.”</p>

<p>Or let us take our stand, with the same philosopher, in that
<i>Œil-de-Bœuf</i>, in the Versailles Palace Gallery—through which
what figures have passed, and vanished! “Figures? Men?
They are fast-fleeting Shadows; fast chasing each other: it is
not a Palace, but a Caravansera.”</p>

<p class="noindent">This may remind us of Mrs. Battle’s apology for whist, or of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
concluding sentence in a characteristic confession by Benjamin
Constant—who, by the way, had said of himself in a previous
letter, <i>Je passerai comme une <span class="smcap">ombre</span> sur la terre entre le malheur
et l’ennui</i>—he records his <i>sentiment profond et</i> (like his name)
<i>constant</i> of the shortness of life—a sentiment, he says, so deep
and so constant that it makes the pen or the book drop from
his hand whenever he takes to study: “Nous n’avons pas plus
de motifs pour acquérir de la gloire, pour conquérir un empire
ou pour faire un bon livre, que n’en avons pour faire une
promenade ou une partie de whist.” Even so utterly different
a man in creed and character as Joseph de Maistre could exclaim,
“Ah! le vilain monde! j’ai toujours dit qu’il ne pourrait
aller si nous avions le sens commun.... C’est nôtre folie
qui fait tout aller.” Else when we see—especially when death
brings home to us, strikes home to us—what shadows we are,
and what shadows we pursue, “en vérité chacun se coucherait
et daignerait à peine s’habiller.” <i>N’importe! tout marche et c’est
assez.</i> And readers of M. de Tocqueville’s letters will remember
how often that philosophic writer confides to his correspondents
his conviction that there is no one thing in the world capable of
fixing and satisfying him. He had attained a success unhoped for
at the beginning of his career, but was far from happy. Often, in
imagination, he would fancy himself at the summit of human
greatness; and when there, the conviction would force itself
irrepressibly upon him, that the same painful sensations would
follow him to that sublime altitude.</p>

<p>Succeeding? What is the great use of succeeding? muses
the master showman of Vanity Fair. Failing? Where is the
great harm? “Psha! These things appear as nought, when
Time passes—Time the consoler—Time the anodyne—Time
the grey calm satirist, whose sad smile seems to say, Look, O
man, at the vanity of the objects you pursue, and of yourself
who pursue them!”</p>

<p>The professed cynic, remarks an essayist on the theme of
Occasional Cynicism, has reached the delightful conclusion that
“the whole thing,” by which he means life and all its interests,
is a sheer mistake and piece of confusion. And as it presents
itself to the grander and loftier type of mind, this difficulty is
held by the same writer to be the “starting-point of all systems
of religion and philosophy, of which it is the object to show
either that aims exist before men’s eyes that are solid realities
worth pursuing, and not mere shadows, or else that even
shadows are better worth pursuing in some one way than in all
others.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey’s earlier letters abound in almost cynical reflections on
the folly of ambition and the “ridiculous self-importance” implied
in “heroic toils.” The whole game of life seemed to him
a little childish, “and the puppets that strut and look lofty very
nearly as ridiculous as those that value themselves on their airs
and graces—poor little bits of rattling timber—to be jostled in
a bag as soon as the curtain drops.” “God help us! it is a
foolish little thing this human life at the best; and it is half
ridiculous and half pitiful to see what importance we ascribe to
it, and to its little ornaments and distinctions,” etc. We are, as
a modern poet of name and promise puts it, for ever at hide-and-seek
with our souls:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">... “Not in Hades alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth Sisyphus roll, ever frustrate, the stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do the Danaïds ply, ever vainly, the sieve.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tasks as futile does earth to its denizens give.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When we reflect on the shortness and uncertainty of life,
how despicable, exclaims David Hume, seem all our pursuits of
happiness! And even if we would extend our concern beyond
our own life, he goes on to say, how frivolous appear our most
enlarged and most generous projects, when we consider the
incessant changes and revolutions of human affairs, by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
laws and learning, books and governments, are hurried away by
time, as by a rapid stream, and are lost in the immense ocean
of matter. If such a reflection certainly tends to mortify all our
passions, does it not, asks the essayist, thereby counterwork the
artifice of nature, by which we are “happily deceived into an
opinion that human life is of some importance? And may not
such a reflection be employed with success by voluptuous
reasoners, in order to lead us from the paths of action and
virtue into the flowery fields of indolence and pleasure?” The
Chinese have been pointed to, by a moral philosopher, to point
his moral, which is, the desolating tendency of secularism—they
having learnt practically, as well as theoretically, to think
of themselves as mere transitory beings, who have no future
life to expect, and no present Providence to reverence or fear;
and the result he takes to be, that they are the meanest, the
most deceitful, and one of the most vicious nations in the
world—a people who literally sit in darkness, and whose lives
are passed in the shadow of death. “In all the world there is
no more terrible or instructive example of the practical results
of looking upon men as mere passing shadows, who have no
superior and no hereafter.” Once succeed, this writer argues,
in persuading men that they are mere passing phenomena,
possessing no more distinctive qualities than the successive
waves of the sea, and the consequence is inevitable. “They
will cease—gradually, imperceptibly, and with all sorts of
moral, and perhaps religious, reflections on their lips—to care
for what is great, permanent, and noble, and they will become,
in the fullest sense of the words, beasts that perish.”</p>

<p>Many men, says Archdeacon Hare, spend their lives in
gazing at their own shadows, and so dwindle away into shadows
thereof. And one of his companion guessers at truth remarks,
that instead of watching the bird as it flies above our heads,
we chase his shadow along the ground; and, finding we cannot
grasp it, we conclude it to be nothing.</p>

<p>If a man be a reality, says John Sterling, no empty vision in
the dreaming soul of nature, but inwardly substantial and personal,
that which he most earnestly desires, which best satisfies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
his whole being, must be real too. And here is a parallel
passage from a later writer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yes, this life is the war of the False and the True,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet this life is a truth, though so complex to view</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ay, the world but a frivolous phantasm seems,</div>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Genesis</span> xi. 28.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a pathetic significance in what to the unobserving
reader might seem a dry record of decease,
commonplace among other commonplaces, in the fact mentioned
concerning the house of Terah, the father of Abraham,—that
“Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.”</p>

<p>It is, as Canon Melvill says, like an inversion of the natural
order, when we see parents performing the last office to their
children: we feel it natural that children should close the eyes,
and shroud the limbs of fathers and mothers, but unnatural that
fathers and mothers should perform these sad duties for children.
“Haran should have followed Terah, and not Terah Haran.”</p>

<p>A great French moralist, in his exposition of the sublime
intensity of a father’s love, goes on to say of the tie, the <i>lien</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
which unites devoted parent to endeared child, “Et la nature
brise ce lien. Elle jette au tombeau cette vie qui commence,
et condamne le père à rester vivant.” A tender poet of our
day was writing from such an experience—not in his case an
isolated one—when bewailing the gem of his hearth, his household
pride, who, could love have saved from death, would have
found a father’s love, and a mother’s, stronger than death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Humbly we bow to Fate’s decree;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet had we hoped that Time should see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee mourn for us, not us for thee.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Les funérailles des fils</i>, says another French author, <i>sont
toujours contre la nature quand les parents y assistant</i>. How often
Edmund Burke harps on that tremulously vibrating string, in
reference to the master-grief which overshadowed his closing
period of life! In a letter to Dr. Lawrence, he expresses his
thankfulness to God for dismissing him “so gently from life,”
and being sent, he adds, “to follow those who in course ought
to have followed me.” In his famous letter to the Duke of
Bedford, the bereaved old man utters the lament: “I live in
an inverted order. They who ought to have succeeded me
have gone before me. They who should have been to me as
posterity, are in the place of ancestors.” Shakspeare had
anticipated the thought, and the expression of the thought,
when he made old Lucretius exclaim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If in the child the father’s image lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where shall I live, now Lucrece is unlived?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wast not to this end from me derived.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If children predecease progenitors,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are their offspring, and they none of ours.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So again he makes Capulet cry out, at the loss of his daughter
Juliet, “O thou untaught! what manners is in this, to press
before thy father to a grave!” Writing to a kinsman on the
birth of a son, Burke gives utterance to the wish, “May he live
to be the staff of your age, and to close your eyes in peace;
instead of, like me, reversing the order of nature, and having
the melancholy office to close <i>his</i>.” And to his “dear little
niece,” Mary, he thus writes after the birth of her son (Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
Haviland Burke): “May you see your son a support to your
old age; ... and at a very long day may <i>he</i> close <i>your</i>
eyes, not as I have done those of your admirable cousin.” His
progeny may never be his posterity, muses Sir Thomas Browne,
in his meditations on man: “he may go out of the world less
related than he came into it; and considering the frequent
mortality in friends and relations, in such a term of time, he
may pass away divers years in sorrow and black habits, and
leave none to mourn for himself; orbity may be his inheritance.”</p>

<p>Bitterly Mohammed bewailed the death of his four sons by
Kadijah, who died in their infancy; and especially that of one
by Maria the Egyptian; for not only was this fatal to his hopes
of founding an hereditary religious dynasty, but it affected his
claims to pre-eminent favour with God. “Al-as Ebn Wayel, who
was so cruel and so daring as to insult him on the loss of his
favourite boy, ... was accursed of heaven, and a special
Sura (the 108th) was revealed to console the Prophet.” Bitterly
Saint Stephen, the first king of Hungary, bewailed the loss of
his promising son Emeric—the first of a series of shocks that
hastened his own end. Like the desolate sire in Scott’s poem
who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent8">... “beheld aghast,</div>

<p>Réné of Anjou, in surviving his male offspring, was the last
representative of his race. Southey observes that <i>Pauli in
domo præter se nemo superest</i>, is a reflection passing melancholy
in the speech of Paulus Æmilius; and applying it to his own
emphatically good physician, he says, that the speedy extinction
of his family in his own person was often in the Doctor’s
mind, and that he would sometimes touch upon it, to dear
friends, in moods of autumnal feeling.</p>

<p>Michelet’s record of the death of Charles le Bel, who leaving
only a daughter, was succeeded by a cousin, closes with the
reminder, “All that fine family of princes who had sat near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
their father at the council of Vienne, was extinct. In the
popular belief, the curse of Boniface had taken effect.” So with
Alexander III. of Scotland, whose eldest son died soon after
his marriage, leaving no issue, and whose second son died while
a boy; other bereavements followed, and the king came to
feel in fact as the patriarch felt by anticipation, that to be
bereaved of one’s children, was bereavement indeed. King
James V., in like manner the survivor of both his sons, died a
broken-hearted man.</p>

<p>Laelio Torelli, the Florentine statesman and man of letters,
survived all his children. Shakspeare lost his only son some
twenty years before his own decease. Vincentio Scamozzi, the
architect, who died the same year as Shakspeare, caused no
little talk at the time, by the very singular will he left, betokening
a most extraordinary solicitude for the perpetuation of his
name, as he had the grief of outliving his offspring. Sir Francis
Vere’s three sons and two daughters all died before him. It
was accounted a signal calamity in the career of that true
nobleman, the Duke of Ormond, that he outlived “the noble-minded
Ossory,” worthy son of such a sire.</p>

<p>“The feeble wrap the athletic in his shroud; and weeping
fathers build their children’s tomb.” Young’s is that truism;
and Pope’s is the cognate query, “Say, was it virtue, more
though Heaven ne’er gave, lamented Digby, sunk thee to the
grave?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>Passing in his Meditations from single persons to families,
Marcus Antoninus refers to that of the Pompeys, for one
instance, as wholly extinct. “This man was the last of his
house,” he says, is not an uncommon inscription upon a
monument. As with Homer’s Phænops, in feeble age, who lost
his joy and hope in young Xanthus and Thoön:</p>

<p>Who on his staff is this? we ask with Ossian; who is this
whose head is white with age, whose eyes are red with tears,
who quakes at every step? “It is thy father, O Morar!”
dead and gone Morar: “the father of no son but thee....
Weep, thou father of Morar; weep, but thy son heareth thee
not. Deep is the sleep of the dead—low their pillow of
dust.” This flies sure to the old man’s heart, says Schiller’s
Illo of the elder Piccolomini,</p>

<p>Peter the Great, whether guilty or not of putting to death
his elder son, Alexis, was inconsolable for the loss of the only
remaining one. It was the fate of Queen Anne to lose, at
twelve years of age, the hopeful young prince who alone
survived of all her very many children.</p>

<p>Samuel Richardson was the saddened survivor of all his five
sons and a daughter. The celebrated Dutch philosopher and
mathematician, ’Sgravesande, who, by the way, was born within
the same year with Richardson, lost his two sons within eight
days of each other, and is honoured for the Christian resignation
with which he bore the sharp trial. Sir John Vanbrugh
lost his only son at the battle of Tournay. Bishop Warburton
died not long after his only son, who was carried off by a
decline in the springtide of life. It is of a distinguished Swiss
littérateur, who died in his prime, that Sainte-Beuve somewhere
says <i>que sa destinée tranchée avant l’heure a pourtant été complète,

children have gone before her, she is so old.</p>

<p>The gathering sorrows which clouded the latter years of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Bishop Percy, “after a life in the main prosperous and
happy,” commenced with the loss of an only son.</p>

<p>Lord Kenyon died in 1802, “sorrow-stricken by the loss
of his eldest son, after having accumulated a fortune of
£300,000.” Lord Stowell lost his son, aged forty-two, about
two months only before he too fell on death. Sprengel, the
very learned German physician, never recovered the stroke
of his son’s loss. Cuvier’s four children all died before him.
“Write ye this man childless:” many a man of genius has
felt his heart sink and his strength fail under that blighting
sentence. In his sixty-seventh year we find Moore writing,
“The last of our five children is now gone, and we are left
desolate and alone. Not a single relative have I now left
in the world.” How Mr. Hallam was successively bereaved
of sons so rich in promise, if not in performance, is too
well known.</p>

<p>There is a seeming affectation of literary paternity in what
Chateaubriand writes of the death of Byron,—as though it
were Terah and Haran, with a difference. “I preceded him in
life; he preceded me in death. He was summoned before
his time. My number came before his, and yet his was
drawn first from the urn. It was Childe Harold who ought
to have remained.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MOTE_AND_THE_BEAM"><i>THE MOTE AND THE BEAM.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> vii. 5.</p>

</div>

<p>As easy is it to discern the mote in a brother’s eye as
to discern the face of the sky. Hypocrite is the term
by which the facile discerner in either case is divinely stigmatised;
in the one instance, because with all his discernment he
cannot read the signs of the times; in the other, because with
all his insight and microscopic nicety of perception, and
exceptionally developed faculty of vision, he yet considers not
the beam that is in his own eye.</p>

<p>With our Lord’s words concerning the mote and the beam,
Archbishop Trench bids us compare the Chinese proverb,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
“Sweep away the snow from thine own door, and heed not
the frost upon thy neighbour’s tiles.” The Greek and Latin
classics are not wanting in various readings of the same theme.
Demosthenes meant much the same thing when he said that
we must beware of austerely scrutinizing the actions of others,
unless first we are conscious of having acquitted ourselves
aright: “οὐ γὰρ ἐστι πικρῶς ἐξετάσαι τι πέπρακται τοῖς ἀλλοῖς, ἀν μὴ
παῤ ὑμῶν ἀυτῶν πρῶτον ὑπάρξη τὰ δέοντα.” “Man is blind to his
own faults, but keen-sighted to perceive those of others,” is
a Latin adage: “Vitiis suis pervidendis cæcus est homo,
in alienis perspicax.” “Is it never your way to look at yourself
when you are abusing another?” is a question in Plautus:
“Non soles respicere te, cum dicas injuste alteri?” Cicero
pronounces it to be of the nature of folly to see the faults of
others, and to forget one’s own: “Proprium est stultitiæ
aliorum vitia cernere, oblivisci suorum.” Horace shrewdly
submits that the man who is desirous that his friends should
not take offence at his own protuberances, will “ignore”
that friend’s warts:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Postulat, ignoscat verrucis illius.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And at least as pointed and piquant is the passage beginning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Quum tua pervideas oculis male lippus inunctis,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The query Plautus puts, “How is it that no man tries to
search into himself, but each fixes his eyes on the wallet of the
one who goes before him?” is in allusion to the fable of Jupiter
having loaded men with a couple of wallets; the one, filled
with our own vices, being slung at our backs,</p>

<p>To pardon those absurdities in ourselves which we cannot
suffer in others, is neither better nor worse, says Dean Swift,
than to be more willing to be fools ourselves than to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
others so. The proverbs of all nations show all nations to be
alive to the ridiculous in this respect. The kiln calls the oven,
burnt house, says one. In Italy, the pan says to the pot, Keep
off, or you’ll smutch me. In Spain, the raven bawls hoarsely
to the crow, Get out, blackamoor! (<i>Quítate allá, negro!</i>) In
Germany, one ass nicknames another, Long-ears. And Dr.
Trench is rather taken with a certain originality in the Catalan
version of the proverb: “Death said to the man with his
throat cut, ‘How ugly you look!’” They should be fair, hints
Juvenal, who venture to deride the disproportioned leg or
sooty hide, <i>Loripedem rectus derideat, Æthiopem albus</i>. Yet, as
the Ettrick shepherd once sang in his native Doric:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">Cry out, the whole warld’s unclean.”</div>

<p>Molière’s Chrysale twits her sister Bélise, who is a <i>femme
savante</i>, with snapping up everybody short who makes a slip
with the tongue, while herself liable to graver censure for slips
of conduct:—</p>

<p>Sappho, again, in Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s portentous
romance—once the rage of readers in France, despite its
plurality of volumes, as “Clarissa” was in England, a century
later—ridicules the <i>bizarre</i> orthography of the fine-ladyism of
the day, while amused at the fact that the fine ladies in question,
who perpetrated such gross errors in writing, and who lost every
particle of wit the moment they took up a pen, would yet make
game for days together of some poor foreigner who happened to
use one term for another. As if it were less a matter of mirth
or marvel for a <i>grande dame</i>, claiming to be a woman of wit,
too, and a power in society, to commit a thousand blunders in
writing her native language, than for a raw foreigner to make a
few slips in speaking it.</p>

<p>We every day and every hour, observes Montaigne, say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
things of another that we might more properly say of ourselves,
could we but revert our observation to our own concerns as
well as extend it to others. And the old essayist has his fling
at not a few authors of the day who, in this manner, prejudiced
their own cause by running headlong upon those they attacked,
and darting those shafts against their enemies that might, with
much greater propriety and effect, be hurled back at themselves.</p>

<p>It is of their common friend Breuning that Beethoven writes
to Ferdinand Ries,—“He certainly possesses many admirable
qualities, but he thinks himself quite faultless, whereas the very
defects that he discovers in others are those which he possesses
himself to the highest degree.” One of the most natural and
truthfully, as well as forcibly, drawn characters in Mrs. Inchbald’s
“Simple Story,”—Sandford,—a man of understanding, of learning,
and a complete casuist, yet all whose faults were committed
for the want of knowing better, is described as constantly reproving
faults in others, and most assuredly too good a man
not to have corrected and amended his own, had they been
known to him; but known to him they were not. He had
been, we are told, for so long a time the spiritual superior or
preceptor of all with whom he lived, and so busied with instructing
others, that he had not once recollected that he
needed instruction himself; and in such awe did his habitual
severity keep all about him, that although he had numerous
friends, not one of them told him of his failing. “Was there
not then some reason for him to suppose he <i>had</i> no faults?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
His enemies, indeed, hinted that he had; but enemies he
never hearkened to; and thus, with all his good sense, he
wanted the sense to follow the rule, ‘Believe what your enemies
say of you rather than what is said by your friends.’” He had
yet to learn, and to learn by heart, the wide and practical
import of the prayer—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STRANGERS_AND_PILGRIMS"><i>STRANGERS AND PILGRIMS.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">1 Peter</span> ii. 11.</p>

</div>

<p>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
throughout Asia Minor, addressed the urgent appeal
that <i>as</i> strangers—strangers and pilgrims—they should
abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.</p>

<p>Consider what you are, he seems to say, as his words are
paraphrased by the greatest of all commentators on his first
epistle: “If you were citizens of this world, then you might
drive the same trade” with the men of this world, “and follow
the same lusts; but seeing you are chosen and called out of
this world, and invested into a new society, made free of
another city, and are therefore here but travellers passing
through to your own country, it is very reasonable that there
be this difference betwixt you and the world, that while they
live at home your carriage be such as fits strangers, not glutting
yourselves with their pleasures, nor surfeiting upon their delicious
fruits, as some unwary travellers do abroad; but as
wise strangers living warily and soberly, and still minding most
of all your journey homewards, suspecting dangers and snares
in your way, and so walking with a holy fear, as the Hebrew
word for a stranger imports.”</p>

<p>The topic is one upon which Archbishop Leighton ever
writes feelingly. As again in his comment on the psalmist’s
profession of being a stranger with God, and a sojourner as all
his fathers were, the same devout expositor observes that he
who looks on himself as a stranger, and is sensible of the
darkness round about him in this wilderness, will often put up
that request with David, “I am a stranger in the earth: hide
not Thy commandments from me.” What, Leighton asks, is
the joy of our life, but the thoughts of that other life, our home
before us? “And certainly he that lives much in these
thoughts, set him where you will here, he is not much pleased
nor displeased; but if His Father call him home, that word
gives him his heart’s desire.”</p>

<p>Once again, in the sixth of his lectures on the immortality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
of the soul, Leighton expatiates on the fact that this is not our
rest, that we have no place of residence here below: “it is the
region of fleas and gnats; and while we search for happiness
among these mean and perishing things, we are not only sure to
be disappointed, but also not to escape those miseries which, in
great numbers, continually beset us; so that we may apply to
ourselves the saying of the famous artist confined in the island
of Crete, and truly say,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Nec tellus nostræ, nec patet unda fugæ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restat iter cœli, cœlo tentabimus ire.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(“The earth and the sea are shut up against us, and neither
of them can favour our escape; the way to heaven is alone
open, and this way we will strive to go.”)</p>

<p>Incidentally, it adds to the interest of every such passage in
Leighton’s writings to remember a noteworthy circumstance
respecting his death. He had been used to say that if he
were to choose a place to die in it should be an inn—for that
would look so like a pilgrim’s going home, to whom this world
was all as an inn. It was his opinion, also, as we read in the
memoir of him by Aikman, that “the officious tenderness and
care of friends was an entanglement to a dying man, and that
the unconcerned attendance of those who could be procured
in such a place would give less disturbance.” He had his
wish. At the Bell Inn, Warwick Lane, Robert Leighton, in
his seventy-fourth year, stranger and pilgrim, drew his last
breath.</p>

<p>Of him who walks by faith and not by sight, who places
eternity by the side of time, and so regards the one as a mere
path or stepping-stone to the other, it is well said by Dr.
Chalmers that he actually moves through life in the spirit of a
traveller, feels his home to be heaven, and all his dearest hopes
and interests to be laid up there; “walking therefore over the
world with a more light and unencumbered step than other
men, just because all its adversities to him are but the crosses
of a rapid journey, and all its joys but the shifting scenery of
the land through which he is travelling, and visions of passing
loveliness.”</p>

<p>As in the pilgrim’s song of a contemporary clerical poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My rest is in heaven; my rest is not here:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then why should I murmur when trials are near?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be hushed, my dark spirit! the worst that can come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But shortens thy journey, and hastens thee home.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="center">...</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A scrip on my back, and a staff in my hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I march on in haste through an enemy’s land:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The road may be rough, but it cannot be long;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’ll smooth it with hope, and I’ll cheer it with song.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The second of Bishop Beveridge’s Resolutions comprises
this utterance,—after the expression of a longing that he could
be ever on the mount, taking a view of the land of Canaan,
for then what dreams and shadows would all things here below
appear to be,—“Well! by the grace of God, I am resolved no
longer to tie myself to sense and sight, the sordid and trifling
affairs of this life, but always to walk as one of the other
world; to behave myself in all places, and at all times, as one
already possessed of my inheritance and an inhabitant of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
New Jerusalem;—by faith assuring myself I have but a few
more days to live below, a little more work to do, and be
admitted to a nearer vision and fruition of God, and see Him
face to face.” And thus, although at present here in the flesh,
the believer’s resolve is to look upon himself as more really an
inhabitant of heaven than abiding (for here we have no continuing
city) upon earth.</p>

<p>In the words of <i>l’exilé</i> of Lamennais, “La patrie n’est point
ici-bas; l’homme vainement l’y cherche; ce qu’il prend pour
elle n’est qu’un gite d’une nuit.” Happy they, exclaims Pascal
in his <i>Pensées</i>, whose tears are shed, not at the evanescence
of all things earthly and perishable, but when they remember
Sion—<i>dans le souvenir de leur chère patrie</i>—the heavenly Jerusalem,
after which they sigh continually in the weariness of
their exile. But as Schiller’s Thekla replies to Neubrunn’s
comment on “the journey’s weary length,”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The pilgrim, travelling to a distant shrine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of hope and healing, does not count the leagues.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>John Foster describes the Israelite indeed, who is a pilgrim
indeed, as resembling a person whose eye, while he is conversing
with you about an object or a succession of objects,
should glance every moment towards some great obstacle appearing
on the distant horizon. “He seems to talk to his
friends in somewhat of the manner of expression with which
you can imagine that Elijah spoke, if he remarked to his companion
any circumstance in the journey from Bethel to Jericho,
and from Jericho to the Jordan; a manner betraying the
sublime anticipation which was pressing on his thoughts.” To
other pilgrims the vision of the land that is very far off may be,
as Professor Maurice puts it, not so clear as they wish; but it is
more clear than their vision of anything which lies about them;
and without it all would be shadow and darkness. “There,
in that state, must lie all that they dream of and hope for.”
“There only they must live, or have no life.” “When they
pray ‘Thy kingdom come,’ they ask that the Great Shepherd
will lead them and their brethren out of a land of pits, a thirsty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
wilderness, a valley of the shadow of death, to a peaceable
habitation and a sure dwelling-place.” There is a bleak
desert, in the words of one who wrote sacred songs, though
himself no sacred poet,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">... “where daylight grows weary</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wasting its smiles on a desert so dreary—</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">What may that desert be?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis life, cheerless life, where the few joys that come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are lost like that daylight, for ’tis not their home.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There is a lone pilgrim, before whose faint eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The water he pants for but sparkles and flies—</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Who may that pilgrim be?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis man, hapless man, through this life tempted on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By fair shining hopes, that in shining are gone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In that essay of John Foster’s, from which a citation has
already been made, the essayist protests against the care so
many popular writers seem to take to guard against the inroad
of ideas pertaining to another life—as much care as the inhabitants
of Holland take against the irruption of the sea; and
their writings, he adds, do really form a kind of moral dyke
against the invasion from the other world. “They do not
instruct a man to act, to enjoy, and to suffer, as a being that
may by to-morrow have finally abandoned this orb; everything
is done to beguile the feeling of his being ‘a stranger and a
pilgrim on the earth.’” They fail to recognise the <i>c’est vrai</i> of
the Christian lyrist’s avowal, the—</p>

<p>The object of such a pilgrim is progress—or, rather, progress
is the means to an end; and the end is not yet, is not here,
but will surely come, and come quickly, and will not tarry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
There is a wicket gate towards which they are making progress,
and it is the portal of a city that hath foundations, whose
builder and maker is God. They who professedly sojourn
here as in a strange country, who obey the call to go out into
a place which they shall after receive for an inheritance; who
confess, and act on the confession, that they are strangers and
pilgrims on the earth; they that say and do such things declare
plainly that they seek a country, a better country—that is, a
heavenly.</p>

never be too old to learn:</p>

<p>We are strangers and sojourners before God, as were all our
fathers. By faith it was that Abraham sojourned in the land
of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles
with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;
in tabernacles, that bespeak the stranger and pilgrim upon
earth; not in houses built to endure. For he confessed, and
denied not, but confessed that here he had no continuing city.
True, a citizen he was of no mean city. But it was not of the
earth, earthy. For he looked for a city which hath foundations,
more everlasting than the hills. Meanwhile, God’s statutes
were his songs in the house of his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The Bird of God is Wordsworth’s epithet for that “resplendent
wanderer” called by Eastern islanders the Bird of Heaven,
and by us of the West, Bird of Paradise; and, as usual with
the serenely meditative bard of Rydal, there is moral, nay,
religious teaching in the symbolism of his strain:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>An appalling pestilence raged in Carthage, and so gave
deadly emphasis to the exhortations of St. Cyprian, when he, a
good shepherd, sought to lead the sheep of his flock to green
pastures and still waters of comfort; reminding them, as he
stood between the living and the dead, while as yet the plague
was stayed not, that they had renounced the world, and were
abiding here as strangers and pilgrims only. “Let us,” he
besought them, “embrace that time which gives to each one
his home, which, delivering us from this world, and loosing
us from worldly snares, restores us to paradise and the kingdom.”
Who, he asks, that is placed in a foreign land, would not
hasten to return to his own country? Who that saileth towards
his own, would not eagerly desire a prosperous wind to bring
him swiftly to the embrace of those he loves? “Our country
we believe to be paradise: the patriarchs we esteem our
parents. Why, then, do we not speed and run, that we may
behold our country and salute our parents?”</p>

<p>Salutary though the sentiment be, however, it admits of one-sided
exaggeration. There are good people who, for instance,
exalt and expatiate upon the death of godly infants, as though
to quit this earth of ours at the very earliest date were the
most blessed of privileges. The idea of man being sent into
the world for any definite purpose never seems, it has been
justly said, to enter the minds of these good people. “With
them life is but an irksome omnibus-journey—the shorter the
better—and to be got over by each without any regard to the
comfort or requirements of his fellow-travellers.” Only in part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
are these strictures on “the shorter the better” applicable, if
at all, to the theme and expression of Mrs. Browning’s
sonnet:—</p>

<p>Addison devotes a paragraph in one of his <i>Spectators</i> to the
fact of men being in Scripture called strangers and sojourners
upon earth, and life a pilgrimage. And he refers to several
heathen as well as Christian authors, who under the same kind
of metaphor have represented the world as an inn, which was
only designed to furnish us with accommodation in this our
passage. It is therefore very absurd, urges our moral essayist,
to think of setting up our rest before we come to our journey’s
end; and not rather to take care of the reception we shall there
meet with, than to fix our thoughts on the little conveniences
and advantages which we enjoy one above another in the way
to it.</p>

<p>“The Illusiveness of Life” is the title of a sermon on the
patriarchs as sojourners in a strange country, by the late
F. W. Robertson, of Brighton; who with characteristic force
and insight explains the deception of life’s promise, and the
meaning of that deception. He shows how our natural anticipations
deceive us—every human life being a fresh one, bright
with hopes that will never be realized. With our affections, he
goes on to say, it is still worse, because they promise more.
“Men’s affections are but the tabernacles of Canaan—the tents
of a night—not permanent habitations, even for this life.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
Where, he asks, are the charms of character, the perfection and
the purity and the truthfulness which seemed so resplendent in
our friend? They were only the shape of our own conceptions—our
creative shaping intellect projected its own fantasies on
him; and hence we outgrow our early friendships—outgrow the
intensity of all: we dwell in tents; we never find a home, even
in the land of promise, any more than Abraham did. “Life is
an unenjoyable Canaan, with nothing real or substantial in it.”
But there is another beside the sentimental way, trite enough,
of considering this aspect of life—as a bubble, a dream, a delusion,
a phantasm, and that other is the way of faith. “The
ancient saints felt as keenly as any moralist could feel the
brokenness of life’s promises: they confessed that they were
strangers and pilgrims here; they said that they had here no
continuing city; but they did not mournfully moralize on this;
they said it cheerfully, and rejoiced that it was so.” Strangers—the
very term implies a distant home. Pilgrims—the law of
whose pilgrimage is to make progress. Forgetting the things
behind; rating at their true worth the things around; earnestly
pressing forward to the things before. Keble’s devout lyric on
the escape to Zoar is pitched in this key:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Sweet is the smile of home; the mutual look</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When hearts are of each other sure;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Yet in the world even these abide, and we</div>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Psalm</span> xli. 9.</p>

</div>

<p>The psalmist’s enemies were speaking evil of him: when
should he die, and his name perish? All that hated
him were whispering together against him, and devising hurt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
But this he could bear, on the part of declared foes. What
he could not bear was that his own familiar friend, in whom
he trusted, and who ate of his bread, should have lifted up his
heel against him.</p>

<p>Hengstenberg remarks that in Judas the expression, “Which
did eat of my bread,” receives its full, its frightful verification,
in the fact of his participating in the Last Supper—to say
nothing of habitually sharing in previous and everyday meals.</p>

<p>Even a comparatively slight wound may be severe when
dealt by a friend. Dr. Colani thinks that never could the
Son of man have felt so acutely the pain caused by opposition
and non-recognition as when He received the message from
John the Baptist, inquiring into the credentials of His Divine
mission. That the rulers of the people, that one of the twelve,
that those of His own kin, should doubt or dispute His mission,
was hard enough to bear, but perhaps easy to foresee. But
when he who had baptized Him, who had, so to speak, revealed
Him to Himself,—when His “spiritual father” took his stand
among the doubters, “Jesus must have felt a heartrending surprise,
a veritable consternation:” for the Baptist was not a reed
shaken with the wind, and yet, if the Divine hand rested on
that support, what but a reed was it, to pierce, even while it
gave way?</p>

<p>The <i>Et tu, Brute!</i> of dying Cæsar is a large utterance,
hardly more deep in reproachful pathos than wide of application.
The bitterness of its import, varying in intensity, has
sufficed to choke bad men and good and indifferent,—as a
pang more sharp than all. What stung Jugurtha to the heart
was the treachery of his confidential agent, Bomilcar, who intrigued
to betray him to the Romans. What Cicero professes
to have felt most keenly, during the Clodian troubles, was the
perfidious conduct to him of that Serranus to whom, when
consul, he had been so kind; nor was it the least bitter drop
in the cup he had to drain at the last, that the leader of the
band who took his life was one whose life Cicero had once
saved, as counsel for the defence. Antony in the tragedy is
naturally made to brood most resentfully on the being betrayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
by one on whose bosom he had “slept secure of injured faith.”
He can forgive a foe, but not a friend:</p>

<p>Herod the Great felt the pang when that dark and horrible
secret, as Milman calls it, came to light, that Antipater, the
beloved son, for whom he had imbrued his hands in the blood
of his own children—Antipater, the heir of his kingdom—was
“clearly proved to have conspired with Pheroras (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 5)
to poison his old and doting father, and thus to secure and
accelerate his own succession.” Michelet’s narrative of the
decline and death of the Emperor Frederick II. comprises this
record: “Finally his chancellor, his dearest friend, Peter de
Vineâ, attempted to poison him. After this last blow it only
remained for him to veil his face, like Cæsar on the ides of
March.” And familiar to us all is the story of our Henry II.,
sick and bedridden, inquiring the names of the supporters of his
rebellious son Richard. He was for declaring John, the
youngest of his sons, and as he thought the most attached to
him, heir to all his continental dominions. But on hearing the
name of his beloved John, highest on the list of Richard’s
adherents, Henry was seized with a sort of convulsive agitation,
sat up in bed, and gazing around with searching and haggard
look, exclaimed, “Can it be true that John, my heart, the son
of my choice, on whom I doted more than on all the rest, and
my love for whom has brought on me all my woes, has fallen
from me?” Assured that so it was, “Well then,” sighed
Henry, falling back on his bed, and turning his face to the wall,
“henceforward let all go on as it may; I no longer care for
myself nor for the world.” And in this connection may be
mentioned the dying exclamation of Henry’s murdered chancellor.
“What is this, Reginald?” cried Becket to Fitzurse,
when the latter made up to him, bared sword in hand: “I have
loaded you with favours, and <i>you</i> come to me armed, and in the
church?” The last stroke that broke down the aged Pope
Boniface VIII., bowed with the weight of eighty-six years, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
the defection of his favourite and favoured nephew. One may
apply to such defections the upbraidal in a latter-day poem
on Old Pictures in Florence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Giotto, how, with that soul of yours,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Could you play me false who loved you so?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some slight if a certain heart endures,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It feels, I would have your fellows know.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well—I perceive not why I should care</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To break a silence that suits them best;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the thing grows somewhat hard to bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When I find a Giotto join the rest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Most painful to Luther, in his last moments, was the controversy
forced upon him by the defection of so dear a friend
as Agricola, the leader of the Antinomians. He had long before
that expressed his “astoundment” at the secession of Œcolampadius
and Regius, and other intimate associates. “Why
should I fret and fume against the papists?” he wrote in 1531:
“all they have done against me has been in fair, open war;
we are declared enemies, and act as such. They who hurt me
are my own dear children. My brothers, <i>fraterculi mei, aurei
amiculi mei</i>.... I thought I had gone through, had
exhausted all the adversities the evil one could inflict; but it
was not so. My Absalom, the child of my heart, had not
deserted his father, had not poured out ignominy upon David;
my Judas, the traitor who delivered up his master, had not sold
me: he has done so now.”</p>

<p>If Mary Stuart had any quarter to which, in her disastrous
condition, she might look for love and favour, it was, says the
most popular of historians of Scotland, her brother Murray.
<i>His</i> kindness and compassion she deserved, after loading him
with favours, as well as pardoning him considerable offences.
But his acceptance of the regency broke all remaining ties of
tenderness betwixt him and his sister. Scott is not romancing
when, in an historical romance, he describes her reception of
the news. “The queen gave a sort of shriek, and clapping her
hands together, exclaimed, ‘Comes the arrow out of his quiver?—out
of my brother’s bow?’” When Elizabeth appointed
commissioners to inquire into Mary’s case, the Regent Murray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
appeared before them, “in the odious character of the accuser
of his sister, benefactress, and sovereign.” To adopt the sentiment
of the most sententious of stage moralists, When ingratitude
barbs the dart of injury, the wound has double danger
in it.</p>

<p>What touched Cortez most nearly, at the time of the expulsion
from Mexico, was to find the name of his trusted friend,
his <i>intimado</i>, his <i>privado</i>, the secretary Duero, at the head of
the paper of remonstrance presented by his disaffected soldiers.
We find Louis XVI., on the eve of his execution, inquiring with
calm curiosity, and as though not personally affected, how certain
members of the convention whom he knew had voted at
his trial. Told that his cousin of Orleans had voted for his
death, “Ah!” he exclaimed to Malesherbes, “that affects me
more than all the rest.” It was, remarks Lamartine, the comment
of Cæsar when he recognised the face of Brutus amongst
his murderers; he alone roused him to speak.</p>

<p>So spake the captain of Plymouth, but with more of anger
in his sorrow, in the New England hexameters devoted by
Longfellow to Miles Standish, when he charged John Alder
with having supplanted, defrauded, betrayed him:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>It was the revolt of his beloved son Conrad which crushed
to the earth the emperor Henry IV. What Dean Milman
calls “the almost fatal effect” of his conduct on his father,
can only be ascribed to profound affection, deeply, cruelly,
wantonly wounded. “The revolt of Conrad seemed to crush
the aged Emperor to the earth. He had borne all the
vicissitudes of his earlier life with unbroken courage, he had
risen from his humiliation at Canosa with refreshed energy; he
now abandoned himself to despair, threw off the robes and insignia
of royalty, and was hardly prevented by his friends from
falling on his own sword.”—There is a spice of the <i>et tu Brute</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
bitterness in Becket’s exclamation to John of Poitiers, when
even that most ardent of his admirers followed him to Etampes,
and implored him to yield. “And you too,” cried the primate,
in a pang of wrath, “will you strangle us”—<i>ut quid nos et vos
strangulatis</i>?—The great Emperor Frederick II. reproached
Pope Gregory IX., in the height of their contest, as having
been, while in the lower orders of the Church, his familiar
friend; but that no sooner had he reached the height of his
ambition than he threw off all gratitude, and became his
determined foe.—When Queen Elizabeth broke out on a
party of the peers for urging her whither she would not,
Norfolk she as good as called traitor and conspirator, and
Pembroke she said talked like a foolish soldier; but to
Leicester it was that she exclaimed, “You, my lord, you! If
all the world forsook me I thought that you would be true!”—Charles
I.’s celebrated letter to Prince Rupert after the
loss of Bristol, depriving him of his command, begins with
assuring him that the surrender, in such a manner, and by his
trusted, no longer trusty nephew, of that most important city,
was the greatest trial of his constancy that had yet befallen
him: “For what is to be done, after one that is so near me as
you are, both in blood and friendship, submits himself to so
mean an action (I give it the easiest term)? such—I have
so much to say, that I will say no more of it.” The tone is
that of the duke in Mr. Browning’s <i>Colombe’s Birthday</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But a later scene proves that Augustus is not even yet aware
of all the accomplices; and the conviction of Æmilie as one of
them, wrings from him, as Brutus from the elder Cæsar, the
upbraiding cry, <i>Et toi, ma fille, aussi!</i></p>

<p>One touching incident marks the horror of the murder of
the Czar Paul in 1801. The dress of Ouvaroff, one of the
conspirators, is said to have caused him to be mistaken by the
Emperor for his son Constantine; and, according to Bignon,
the last words which the unhappy monarch uttered were, “And
you too, my Constantine!”</p>

Et-tu-Brutefied. The first Lord Holland, when

social virtues to be made seriously unhappy by the conduct of
his worthless companions, particularly by that of Rigby, the
most worthless of them all;</p>

treachery in persons who have won our confidence; that it
tempts one to question the reality of human virtue, to suspect
the hollowness of all appearance of truth and piety, whence
there is but a step to calling in question the moral purpose for
which we are placed on earth. Hawthorne somewhere intimates
that the young and pure are not apt to find out how actually
sin is in the world, until that miserable truth is brought home

<p class="noindent">Henry reminds Scroop that he bore the key of all his counsels,
and knew the very bottom of his soul; and he wept for <i>him</i>,—“for
this revolt of thine, methinks, is like another fall of man.”—A
later king of England, Edward IV., is made to despair
when he sees his brother Clarence among the supporters of
the foe: “Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too? Nay,
then, I see that Edward needs must down.”—And once again,

<p class="noindent">But as we recur to this, as the first among these secular

Psalms: “For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then
I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me that

The companionship past intensifies the cruelty present. Without

together, and companionship hallowed by the sanctuary itself,
the present cruelty could have been borne; but with them it
hardly can.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="JUDGE_NOT">“<i>JUDGE NOT.</i>”</h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> vii. 1.</p>

</div>

<p>A stringent motive is adduced to enforce the strenuous
monition, “Judge not,”—and it is, “that ye be not judged.
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and
with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”
There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy;
even He who hath committed all judgment unto the Son: who
art thou that judgest another?</p>

<p class="tb">Appalled were all who gazed on the last struggles of Cardinal
Beaufort, rendered hideous by the tortures of agonizing remorse.
Hope had he none. Despair was impersonated in the frenzied
contortions of that dying man. King and peers stood beside
the death-bed, awe-stricken and shocked. The king prayed
for the cardinal, that the Eternal mover of the heavens might
“look with a gentle eye upon this wretch:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O beat away the busy meddling fiend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That lays strong siege upon this wretch’s soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from his bosom purge this black despair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">See, says a less gentle observer, Warwick, how the pangs of
death do make him grin. Royal Henry, on devouter thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
intent, bids “peace to his soul,” in parting, “if God’s pleasure
be.” And then the monarch solemnly, urgently, importunes
the moribund cardinal to give some token, ere he quite depart,
that Despair has not made him all her own: “Lord cardinal,
if thou think’st on heaven’s bliss, hold up thy hand, make
signal of thy hope.” But the cardinal—dies, and makes no
sign. The appeal is fruitless: no hand is held up; no signal
of hope displayed. The baffled prince, cut to the heart, can
but exclaim, “He dies, and makes no sign: O God, forgive
him!” Warwick again interposes a harsher voice, “So bad a
death argues a monstrous life,” he is sure. But his sovereign
hushes his damning criticism with a right royal veto:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<span class="smcap">Forbear to judge</span>, <i>for we are sinners all</i>.</div>
    <div class="center">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let us all to meditation.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Forbear to judge. And the Shakspearean Henry practises
in person the monition thus enforced. It is his rule to check
in himself every tendency to uncharitable judgment. As when
proof all but positive distresses him of his uncle Gloster’s
death being due to violence, he yet restrains the bent of his
convictions by the prayer,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey’s life!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If my suspèct be false, forgive me, God;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For judgment only doth belong to Thee!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is by the deathbed of the man self-convicted of Duke
Humphrey’s death, that Henry can yet say, even of him, when
from so bad a death is argued a monstrous life, Forbear to
judge, for we are sinners all.</p>

<p>Are we to infer that Shakspeare was himself for backing to
the full this royal veto? That, perhaps, were going too far.
The veto is dramatically true to character, and designedly
characteristic of the royal speaker. But if Shakspeare himself
(we are assuming him to <i>be</i> the author of this disputed play)
would or could scarcely in this particular instance have enforced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
such a lesson of charity, we may at least be assured, from the
large tolerance and subtle apprehension so patent in his own
kingly nature, that he would in spirit have echoed the king’s
<i>forbear</i>. Perhaps his own feeling might be as nearly as possible
expressed in other words of his, put into the mouth of quite
another character, and referring to quite another occasion:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And how his audit stands, who knows, save heaven?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, in our circumstance and course of thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis heavy with him.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Forbear to judge, is, nevertheless, the moral of this strain, as
of the other. Human ignorance in the one case, human frailty
in the other, ousts human nature from the judgment-seat.</p>

<p>No man, avers Sir Thomas Browne, can justly censure or
condemn another; because, in fact, no man truly knows
another. “This I perceive in myself; for I am in the dark to
all the world, and my nearest friends behold me but in a cloud....
Further, no man can judge another, because no man
knows himself.” In a former section of this his profession of
faith, this good physician warns those who, upon a rigid application
of the law, sentence Solomon unto damnation,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that they
condemn not only him, but themselves, and the whole world;
“for, by the letter and written word of God, we are without
exception in the state of death: but there is a prerogative of
God, and an arbitrary pleasure above the letter of His own law,
by which alone we can pretend unto salvation, and through
which Solomon might be as easily saved as those who condemn
him.”</p>

<p>The Vicar of Gravenhurst, in his position of parish priest,
owns himself compelled to confess that the best people are not
the best in every relation of life, and the worst not bad in every
relation of life; so that, with experience, he finds himself
growing lenient in his blame, if also reticent in his praise.
“Again and again I say to myself that only the Omniscient can
be the equitable judge of human beings—so complicated are our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
virtues with our failings, and so many are the hidden virtues,
as well as hidden vices, of our fellow-men.” If judge at all we
dare, and do, be it in the spirit and to the letter of Wordsworth’s
counsel:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From all rash censure be the mind kept free;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He only judges right who weighs, compares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, in the sternest sentence which his voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pronounces, ne’er abandons Charity.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well and wisely said La Bruyère, that “La règle de
Descartes, qui ne veut pas que l’on décide sur les moindres
vérités avant qu’elles soient connues clairement et distinctement,
est assez belle et assez juste pour devoir s’étendu au jugement
que l’on fait des personnes.” Real character, as William
Hazlitt says, is not one thing, but a thousand things: actual
qualities do not conform to any factitious standard in the mind,
but rest upon their own truth and nature. “The dull stupor
under which we labour in respect of those whom we have the
greatest opportunities of inspecting nearly, we should do well to
imitate, before we give extreme and uncharitable verdicts
against those whom we only see in passing, or at a distance.”</p>

should have done otherwise?” Who, did he but reflect by

<p>The autobiographer of one of Mr. Wilkie Collins’s earlier
fictions proposes in an opening chapter to give a sketch of his
character. But he sensibly refrains from the execution of a too
ambitious plan. For, “what man can say: I will sound the
depth of my own vices and measure the height of my own
virtues; and be as good as his word? We can neither know
nor judge ourselves—others may judge, but cannot know us—God
alone judges and knows too.”</p>

<p>Dunsford the essayist’s objection to all hasty judgment of
our fellow-creatures is based on the ground of its being “such
an unscientific proceeding.” You comment, he says, upon
another man’s conduct, and attribute motives to him. Now an
ingenious and imaginative person—a lawyer making a speech
for him—might show many different motives of equal probability.
You fix upon one, perhaps because it is consonant to
your own mind and nature, or because it is the uppermost or
easiest one to conjecture; but really you often ignore the
doctrine of chances, and perhaps you will find upon strict
calculation that the chances are fairly four to one against your
having named the right motive. As the winning horse is often
“a dark one,” at any rate not the favourite, so after all some
obscure and improbable motive is often the true cause of a
man’s actions. In short, Dunsford maintains that our condemnation
of others is often as unscientific as it is unchristian.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">declares considerations of this kind to have always induced him
to regard with small respect any attempt to delineate fully and
exactly any human being’s character. He avows his distrust
of our capacity for, even in very humble cases, judging our
neighbour fairly; and cannot but pity the presumption that
must swell in the heart and brain of any ordinary brother of
the race, when daring to pronounce, <i>ex cathedrâ</i>, on the whole
structure and complexion of a great mind, from the comparatively
narrow and scanty materials which can by possibility
have been placed before him.</p>

<p>Men who see <i>into</i> their neighbours, observes Dr. Oliver
Wendell Holmes, are very apt to be contemptuous; but men
who see <i>through</i> them find something lying behind every
human soul which it is not for them to sit in judgment on, or
to attempt to sneer out of the order of God’s manifold universe.</p>

<p>The same wise-hearted writer—wise of heart as well as head—has
a dialogue between doctor and minister concerning a
quasi-reprobate, to whom the former has been kind, and about
whose destiny the other is hardly more severe than certain.
“Bad enough, no doubt,” Doctor Kittredge owns this scampish
half-breed to be; “but might be worse. Has some humanity
left in him yet. Let him go. God can judge him—I can’t.”
“You are too charitable, doctor,” objects the minister. “He
has saved his neck—but his soul is a lost one, I am afraid,
beyond question.” “I can’t judge men’s souls,” the doctor
replies. “I can judge their acts, and hold them responsible
for those; but I don’t know much about their souls. If you
or I had found our soul in a half-breed body, and then been
turned loose to run among the Indians, we might have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
playing just such tricks as this fellow has been trying.” What
said a greater doctor when Boswell asked him whether, in the
case of an aggressor forcing on a duel by ill usage, and getting
killed in it, there is not almost no “ground to hope that he is
gone to a state of happiness”? “Sir,” said Johnson, “we are
not to judge determinately of the state in which a man leaves
this life. He may in a moment have repented effectually.”
And then Johnson quoted, apparently with approval, at any
rate with hopeful interest, an epitaph, from Camden’s Remains,
upon a very wicked man, who was killed by a fall from his
horse, in which epitaph he is supposed to say, “Between the
stirrup and the ground, I mercy asked, I mercy found.” On
another occasion Johnson appealed to Richard Baxter’s avowed
belief that a suicide—if hurried by sudden passion to self-slaughter—may
be saved. And “if,” says Baxter, “it should
be objected that what I maintain may encourage suicide, I
answer, I am not to tell a lie to prevent it.” Who, as Campbell
asks, after surmising that the hand which smote its kindred
heart, might yet be prone to deeds of mercy,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">... “Who may understand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy many woes, poor suicide, unknown?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He who thy being gave shall judge of thee alone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>Qualis vita, finis ita</i>, is a rhyming proverb not quite worthy of
all acceptation. That Country Parson whose Recreations
made him a name (such name, at least, as four initials may
comprise) declares himself to have no look but one of sorrow
and pity to cast on the poor suicide’s grave, and thinks the
common English verdict is right as well as charitable, which
supposes that in every such case reason has become unhinged,
and responsibility is gone. “No doubt it is the saddest of all sad
ends; but I do not forget that a certain Authority, the highest
of all authorities, said to all human beings, ‘Judge not, that ye
be not judged.’ The writer has, in the course of his duty,
looked upon more than one suicide’s dead face; and the lines
of Hood appeared to sketch the fit feeling with which to do so:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Owning her weakness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her evil behaviour;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leaving, with meekness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her soul to her Saviour.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A different spirit informs the Kirk from the day when Wishart
complained that, in their arrogance, her ministers, “as if they
had been privy to the councils of God, or the dispensers of
His vengeance to the world,” presumed to pronounce upon the
future state of their adversaries, and “doomed them, both
body and soul, to eternal torments.” Pity but the poet had
been better man and Christian who wrote these strong lines on
damnatory sentences <i>de mortuis</i>, even when there remains
nought to show—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>More in a reverent spirit, and in a farther-seeing one, is the
mystic finale of the Laureate’s memorable Vision of Sin, and
its open verdict on the obscure crime of a great criminal:—</p>

<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>But in a tongue no man could understand</i>;</div>

<p>Never let it be forgotten, insists a Quarterly Reviewer, that
there is scarcely a single moral action of a single human being
of which other men have such a knowledge—its ultimate
grounds, its surrounding incidents, and the real determining
causes of its merits,—as to warrant their pronouncing a conclusive
judgment.</p>

<p>The writings of Mr. Arthur Helps are honourably distinguished
by an oft-recurring plea for mutual tolerance, on the
ground of the little we really know one of another. In “Companions
of my Solitude,” for instance, the author remarks that
were it only considered how utterly incompetent men are to
talk of the conduct of others as they do, the talkers would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
often be silenced at once, and the sufferers as readily consoled.
Take the one question merely of difference of temperament—which,
amongst men, is probably as great as that amongst the
different species of animals—as between that, for example, of
the lively squirrel and the solemn crane. “Now, if only from
this difference between them, the squirrel would be a bad
judge of the felicity, or generosity, or the domestic conduct, of
the crane.</p>

<p>“Probably when we are thinking or talking of a person, we
recall some visual image of that person. I have thought
what an instructive thing it would be, if under some magic
influence—like that, for example, which would construct a
‘palace of truth’—it were arranged that as we gave out our
comments on the character or conduct of any person, this
image on the retina of memory should change according to the
truth, or rather the want of it, in our remarks. Gradually,
feature after feature would steal away till we gazed at nonentity,
or we should find another image glide into the field of view,—somebody
we had never seen, perhaps, but to whom the comments
we were uttering really did apply.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, our author would have the sufferers from injurious
and unjust comment treat the whole thing as one which
lacked reality. No thoughtful man, he urges, ought to be
long vexed at such stuff, immaterial in every sense: such stuff
as dreams are made of.</p>

<p>In one of his Dialogues, again, he makes Dunsford declare
the most curious thing, as regards people living together,
to be the intense ignorance they sometimes are in of each
other. And Milverton follows up the remark by adding, that
people fulfil a relation towards each other, and only know each
other in that relation: they perform orbits round each other,
each gyrating, too, upon his own axis, so that there are parts
of the character of each which are never brought into view of
the other. In another Dialogue, Milverton refers to the habit
divines have of reminding us, that, in forming our ideas of the
government of Providence, we should recollect that we see
only a fragment. The same observation, in its degree, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
holds to be true as regards human conduct. “We see a little
bit here and there, and assume the nature of the whole. Even
a very silly man’s actions are often more to the purpose than
his friends’ comments on them.”</p>

<p>In yet another of his works, this popular essay-writer devotes
an entire essay to the subject of our judgments of other men.
Who does not feel, he asks, that to describe with fidelity the
least portion of the entangled nature that is within him would
be no easy matter? And yet the same man who feels this,
and who, perhaps, would be ashamed of talking at hazard
about the properties of a flower, of a weed, of some figure in
geometry, will put forth his guesses about the character of his
brother-man, as if he had the fullest authority for all that he
was saying. It is shown in detail how an opinion of some
man’s character and conduct gets abroad which is formed after
a wrong method, by prejudiced persons, upon a false statement
of facts, respecting a matter which they cannot possibly understand;
and how this is then left to be inflated by Folly, and
blown about by Idleness.</p>

<p>There is among Wordsworth’s Poems on the Naming of
Places, one which is memorable if only as containing one of
the most admired lines he ever wrote, descriptive of Lady of
the Mere—</p>

<p class="noindent">—but which is also pertinent to the present occasion, as pointing
a moral, after the poet’s wont to moralise his song. A
man had been seen in the distance by the poet and his friends,
angling. No great harm in that, my masters? Nay; but the
angler was in peasant’s garb, and the season was mid-harvest,
and therefore, and on the spot, they voted him improvident
and reckless. But when they came up to him, these over-hasty
judges found in the man they had summarily condemned, a
poor mortal wasted by sickness, and all too weak to labour in
the harvest-field, but using his best skill to gain a pittance
from the dead unfeeling lake that knew not of his wants:—</p>

<p>Forbear to judge: for how pitifully little is the all we really
know one of another! Mr. Froude has forcibly remarked—even
admitting the remark to be a truism—that whoever has
attended but slightly to the phenomena of human nature has
discovered how inadequate is the clearest insight which he can
hope to attain into character and disposition. “Every one is a
perplexity to himself and a perplexity to his neighbours; and
men who are born in the same generation, who are exposed to
the same influences, trained by the same teachers, and live from
childhood to age in constant and familiar intercourse, are often
little more than shadows to each other, intelligible in superficial
form and outline, but divided inwardly by impalpable and
mysterious barriers.” And yet how ready each “weak unknowing
hand” to hurl the bolts of Heaven against whomsoever
it deems to be Heaven’s foe.</p>

<p>Sir James Stephen bids all hail to Rhadamanthus on his
posthumous judgment-seat in the nether regions. But when
Rhadamanthus comes above ground, holds in his hand the
historical pen, and resolves all the enigmas of hearts which
ceased to beat long centuries ago, more confidently than most
of us would dare to interpret the mysteries of own, Sir James for
one wishes him back again at the confluence of Styx, Phlegethon,
and Cocytus. For, “it is, after all, nothing more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
the surface of human character which the retrospective scrutiny
of the keenest human eye is able to detect.” It is in a subsequent
portion of the same instructive treatise, that the writer
pronounces human justice to be severe, not merely because
man is censorious, but because he reasonably distrusts himself,
and fears lest his weakness should confound the distinctions of
good and evil; and Divine justice to be lenient, because there
alone love can flow in all its unfathomable depths and boundless
expansion, impeded by no dread of error, and diverted by
no misplaced sympathies.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In the course of some remarks on the harshness with which
man is disposed to regard the fellow-man whose doctrine, in
matters of religious faith, differs from his own, the author of the
“Caxton Essays” is impressive on the fact that He who hath
reserved to Himself the right of judging, has imperatively said
to man, whose faculty of judging must be, like man himself,
erring and human, “Judge not, that ye be not judged.” Now,
argues the essayist, of all our offences, it is clear that that offence
of which man can be the least competent judge is an offence of
defective faith. “For faith belongs to our innermost hearts,
and not to our overt actions. And religious faith is therefore
that express tribute to the only Reader of all hearts, on the
value of which man can never, without arrogant presumption,
set himself up as judge.”</p>

<p>If even-handed justice, says Mr. Anthony Trollope, were
done throughout the world, some apology would be found for
most offences. Not that the offences would thus be wiped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
away, and black become white; but much that is now very
black would, he submits, be reduced to that sombre, uninviting
shade of ordinary brown which is so customary to humanity.“<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>

<p>As one of George Eliot’s good parsons has it, God sees us as
we are altogether, not in separate feelings or actions, as our
fellow-men see us. We are always doing each other injustice,
and thinking better or worse of each other than we deserve, he
says, because we only hear and see separate words and actions—not
each other’s whole nature. Do not philosophic doctors
tell us, again, the reflective author in person elsewhere muses,
that we are unable to discern so much as a tree, except by an
unconscious cunning which combines many past and separate
sensations; that no one sense is independent of another, so
that in the dark we can hardly taste a fricassee, or tell whether
our pipe is alight or not, and the most intelligent boy, if accommodated
with claws or hoofs instead of fingers, would be
likely to remain on the lowest form? If so, it is easy to understand
that our discernment of men’s motives must depend on
the completeness of the elements we can bring from our own
susceptibility and our own experience. “See to it, friend, before
you pronounce a too hasty judgment, that your own moral
sensibilities are not of a hoofed or clawed character.” For, as
this penetrating writer insists, in continuation of the metaphor,
the keenest eye will not serve, unless you have the delicate
fingers, with their subtile nerve filaments, which elude scientific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
lenses, and lose themselves in the invisible world of human
sensations.</p>

<p>Deeds which, to quote another popular though less powerful
penwoman, our acquaintance designate our follies, may at
another tribunal be our virtues—our single redeeming points;
who judges rightly, who can rightly judge, where so many of
our efforts are bent to seem other than we are, and the universal
conjuring trick of this world is to throw dust expertly in our
neighbours’ eyes?</p>

<p>Centuries ago, well-nigh two score, it was written by the
most philosophic, and perhaps the best, of Roman emperors,
that men’s actions look worse than they are; and, says he,
“one must be thoroughly informed of a great many things
before one can be rightly qualified to give judgment in the
case.” The sceptic Bayle was a better Christian than Scaliger,
when he protested against the assertion of that peremptory
scholar that Bellarmin did not believe a word of what he
wrote, and was at heart an atheist: besides the testimony of
Bellarmin’s life and deathbed to the contrary, such judgments
are, said Bayle (and no friend to the Jesuits he), a usurpation
of the rights of One who alone is the Judge of hearts, and
before whom there is no dissembling.</p>

<p>An apostle’s reason given for the counsel, Speak not evil one
of another, brethren,—is this: that whoso speaketh evil of his
brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and
judgeth the law. Now, there is one Lawgiver, who is able to
save and to destroy; who art thou that judgest another?</p>

<p>No observant reader of Mr. Carlyle but will have noticed, if
not (which were better) laid to heart, his habitual abstention
from that dogmatism of the judgment-seat in which smaller
spirits delight. For instance, in his moral estimate of so erring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
a genius as Hoffmann, if, in judging him, Mr. Carlyle is forced
to condemn him, it is with mildness, with a desire to do
justice. Let us not forget, urges the critic, that for a mind like
Hoffmann’s, the path of propriety was difficult to find—still
more difficult to keep. “Moody, sensitive, and fantastic, he
wandered through the world like a foreign presence, subject to
influences of which common natures have happily no glimpse.”
A good or a wise man we must not call him; but among the
ordinary population of this world, “to note him with the mark
of reprobation were ungrateful and unjust.” So, again, in the
same author’s review of the life and writings of Werner—who,
always in some degree an enigma to himself, may well be
obscure to us. For “there are mysteries and unsounded
abysses in every human heart; and that is but a questionable
philosophy which undertakes so readily to explain them.”
Religious belief especially, Mr. Carlyle urges, at least when it
seems heartfelt and well-intentioned, is no subject for harsh or
even irreverent investigation. “He is a wise man that, having
such a belief, knows and sees clearly the grounds of it in
himself; and those, we imagine, who have explored with
strictest scrutiny the secret of their own bosoms, will be least
apt to rush with intolerant violence into that of other men’s.”
Still more elaborate and emphatic is the exposition of this
doctrine as applied to the case of Robert Burns. The world,
it is alleged, is habitually unjust in its judgments of such men,
since it decides, like a court of law, by dead statutes, and not
positively but negatively,—less on what is done right, than on
what is or is not done wrong. Whereas, by Mr. Carlyle’s
doctrine, not the few inches of deflection from the mathematical
orbit, which are so easily measured, but the <i>ratio</i> of
these to the whole diameter, constitutes the real aberration.
“This orbit may be a planet’s, its diameter the breadth of
the solar system; or it may be a city hippodrome; nay, the
circle of a ginhorse, its diameter a score of feet or paces. But
the inches of deflection only are measured; and it is assumed
that the diameter of the ginhorse, and that of the planet, will
yield the same ratio when compared to them!” Here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
according to our author, lies the root of many a blind, cruel
condemnation of Burnses, Swifts, Rousseaus, which one never
listens to with approval. “Granted, the ship comes into
harbour with shrouds and tackle damaged; the pilot is blameworthy;
he has not been all-wise and all-powerful: but to
know <i>how</i> blameworthy, tell us first whether his voyage has
been round the globe, or only to Ramsgate and the Isle of
Dogs.”</p>

<p>To a very different style of sinners the same judgment—rather
the same refusal to judge—is accorded, when the doom
of Chaumette, Gobel, and other reddest of red-republican
reprobates, is rehearsed, in the history of France’s reign of
terror, while the revolution was devouring so greedily her
own children. “For Anaxagoras Chaumette, the sleek head
now [April 1794] stript of its <i>bonnet rouge</i> [and a traveller by
tumbril to Sainte Guillotine], what hope is there? Unless
Death <i>were</i> ‘an eternal sleep’? Wretched Anaxagoras! God
shall judge thee, not I.”</p>

<p>Once more: “Unhappy soul! who shall judge him?” is the
historian’s deprecating query in the instance of August of
Poland, the physically strong,—who dies, confessedly a <i>very</i>
great sinner, early in 1733. Who shall judge him?</p>

<p>Corporal Trim was once moved to avow his belief—rather
hotly, for his <i>esprit de corps</i> was piqued—that when a soldier
“gets time to pray, he prays as heartily as a parson—though
not with all his fuss and hypocrisy. Thou shouldst not have
said that, Trim, said my uncle Toby—for God only knows
who is a hypocrite, and who is not. At the great and general
review of us all, Corporal, at the day of judgment (and not till
then)—it will be seen who have done their duties in this
world, and who have not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>In a like spirit, another clerical novelist, of a more recent
type, and whose distinctive evangel is Muscular Christianity,
introduces a “double-first” candidate for orders who reminds
him of Mr. Bye-Ends in Bunyan: “And yet,” comes the
charitable clause conditional, “I believe the man was really
in earnest. He was really desirous to do what was right, as
far as he knew it; and all the more desirous, because he saw,
in the present state of society, what was right would pay him.
God shall judge him, not I. Who can unravel the confusion
of mingled selfishness and devotion that exist even in his own
heart, much less in that of another?”</p>

<p>In Mr. Thackeray’s instance, exception has been taken, on
ethical grounds, by no vulgar critic, to his habit of shrinking
from moral estimate as well as moral judgment, in dealing with
his characters. Into that distinction not without a difference,
this is not the place (nor this the pen) to enter. But the critic
in question—for some years a main support of the <i>National
Review</i>—recognises this avoidance of moral judgment as
springing from kindly feeling, from the just and humble sense
we all should have that our own demerits make it unseemly for
us to ascend the judgment-chair, and from a wide appreciation
of the variety and obscurity of men’s real motives of action.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>“We know in part,” said the apostle; who, therefore,
prophesied in part; always with the assurance that
when that which is perfect is come, then shall that which is in
part be done away. Meanwhile, we see through a glass darkly,
through a medium obscurely—“now I know in part.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>If so it was with him that once was caught up into the third
heavens, much more with his readers. For we are but of yesterday,
and know nothing. “Behold, God is great, and we
know Him not.” At the height of our knowledge we can but
fall back upon the old saying, “Lo, these are parts of His
ways; but how little a portion is heard of Him!” And when
we consider the heavens, the work of His hands; the moon
and the stars, which He hath ordained; the earth beneath,
the ocean round about, the waters under the earth, the pent-up
fires within it,—verily He is a God that hideth Himself still, and
that revealeth but a portion of His work, clouds and darkness
covering the rest. His thoughts are very deep; and what is
man that he should know them, or the son of man that he
should find them out unto perfection? From the topmost
pinnacles attained by science he can see but the utmost part
of them, and cannot see them all.</p>

<p>Locke argues the intellectual and sensible world to be in
this perfectly alike: that the part which we see of them holds
no proportion with what we see not; and that whatsoever we
can reach with our eyes, or our thoughts, of either of them, is
but a point, almost nothing, in comparison with the rest. Shall
he whose birth, maturity, and age, as Beattie has it, scarce fill
the circle of one summer day—shall the poor gnat conclude
nature in collapse because of a passing cloud, not transparent
to the insect’s vision?</p>

<p>Freethinking Lord Shaftesbury begins a section of his “Characteristics”
with the remark, that when we reflect on any
ordinary frame or constitution, either of art or nature, and
consider how hard it is to give the least account of a particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
<i>part</i> without a competent knowledge of the <i>whole</i>, we need not
wonder to find ourselves at a loss in many things relating to the
constitution and frame of the universe. Elsewhere he suggestively
observes, that in an infinity of things mutually relative,
a mind which sees not infinitely, can see nothing fully; “and
since each particular has relation to all in general, it can know
no perfect or true relation of anything in a world not perfectly
and fully known.” And supposing the case of an ignorant
landsman presuming to question the details of a ship’s rigging,
his lordship breaks out into the apostrophe, “O my friend, let
us not thus betray our ignorance, but consider where we are,
and in what a universe. Think of the many parts of the vast
machine in which we have so little insight, and of which it is
impossible we should know the ends and uses; when instead of
seeing to the highest pennons, we see only some lower deck,
and are in this dark case of flesh, confined even to the hold
and meanest station of the vessel.” There is Mrs. Browning’s
usual energy of diction in the exclamation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent14">“Ay, we are forced, so pent,</div>

<p class="noindent">The same good Providence, as Madame de Sévigné writes,
that governs all, shall one day unravel all; we poor mortals
being, in the meanwhile, so many all but stone-blind and utterly
ignorant lookers-on. We suffer, as the author of “Thorndale”
says—there is no doubt about that—and we naturally speak
and think under the sharp pang of our present agony; but the
ultimate and overruling judgment which we form of human
life, should be taken from some calm, impersonal point of
view. “We should command the widest horizon possible.
Of the great whole of humanity we see but a little at a time.
We pause sometimes on the lights only of the picture, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
only on the shadows. How very dark those shadows
seem! Yet if we could embrace in our view the whole of the
picture, perhaps the very darkest shadows might be recognised
as effective or inevitable portions of a grand harmonious
whole.” How closes Thomson his poem of “The Seasons,”
drear Winter then his cue?—with the memorable lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“Ye good distress’d!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye noble few! who here unbending stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath life’s pressure, yet bear up awhile;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what your bounded view, which only saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A little part, deemed evil, is no more:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The storms of wintry time will quickly pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one unbounded spring encircle all.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The theme of our part knowledge, so strictly cabin’d, cribb’d,
confined, is one to which Thomson repeatedly recurs. For
instance, in an earlier book:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">“But here the cloud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So wills Eternal Providence, sits deep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enough for us to know that this dark state,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In wayward passions lost, and vain pursuits,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This infancy of being, cannot prove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The final issue of the works of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By boundless love and perfect wisdom form’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ever rising with the rising mind.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, with emphasis and discretion (as Polonius says), he
puts the query—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Shall little haughty ignorance pronounce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His works unwise, of which the smallest part</div>

<p>Horace Walpole makes use of a similar figure in one of his
three or four thousand published letters: “We are poor silly
animals: we live for an instant upon a particle of a boundless
universe, and are much like a butterfly that should argue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>

them.”</p>

<p>Addison, in one of his essays, comments on the body of an
animal as an object comparatively adequate to our senses, it
being a particular part of Providence that lies within a narrow
compass, so that the eye is able to command it, and by successive
inquiries to search into all its parts. Could the body of
the whole earth, he goes on to say, or indeed the whole universe,
be thus subjected to the examination of our senses, were
it not too big and disproportioned for our inquiries, too unwieldy
for the management of the eye and hand, “there is no
question but it would appear to us as curious and well-contrived
a frame as that of a human body. We should see the same
concatenation and subserviency, the same necessity and usefulness,
the same beauty and harmony, in all and every of its parts,
as what we discover in the body of every single animal.” To
adopt an illustration of Fénélon’s to the same purpose: imagine
the letters of a sentence to be so enormous in size, that a man
could only make out one of them at a time; in that case he
could not read, that is, collect the letters together and discover
the sense of them in combination. So it is, argues the benign
prelate, with the <i>grands traits</i> of Providence in the conduct of
the world at large during the lapse of centuries. It is only the
whole that is intelligible, and the whole is too vast to be scrutinised
near at hand. Each event in the process of ages is like a
separate letter or sign, which is too large for our petty organs,
and which is without a meaning when taken apart from the
rest. A more vigorous philosopher than the gentle Fénélon
compares the universe to a picture, the beauty of which is then
alone perceptible when the true stand-point of perspective is
taken. There are certain inventions in perspective, or certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
beautiful designs, he says, which look all confusion until you
either inspect them from the right point of view, or make use
of some kind of glass or mirror as the medium of observation.
In the same manner the apparent deformities of our fractional
side-views, resolve themselves into harmonious unity when the
eye is directed aright.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson was in an unwontedly placid and benignant
frame of mind, by Boswell’s account, when the two stood together,
one serene autumn night, in Dr. Taylor’s garden, and
the sage delivered himself, in meditative mood, of this noteworthy
surmise: “Sir,” said he, “I do not imagine that all
things will be made clear to us immediately after death, but that
the ways of Providence will be explained to us very gradually.”
Be that as it may, few could have been found more ready than
the melancholic Johnson to agree that meanwhile, until the day

<p>It was at a time of national and household tribulation, when
darkness that might be felt seemed to encompass altar and
hearth, that Joseph de Maistre wrote to a friend in trouble:
“Be it enough for us to know, that for everything there is a
reason with which we shall one day become acquainted; let us
not weary ourselves with seeking out the why and the wherefore,
even when possibly they might be discerned.” He would
have his correspondent bear in mind that the epithet “very
good” is a necessary adjunct to “very great;” and that is
sufficient. The inference is self-evident, that under the sway of
the Being who combines in himself those two qualities—the
<i>très-bon</i> and the <i>très-grand</i>—all the evils we either suffer or witness
must needs be acts of justice or means of reformation
equally indispensable. In the declared love of God to man,
M. de Maistre found a general solution of all the enigmas that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
can offend (<i>scandaliser</i>, in the New Testament sense of putting
a stumbling-block in the way of) our ignorance. “Fixed to one
little point of time and space, we are insane enough to refer all
to this point; and in so doing we are at once blameworthy and
absurd.” If De Maistre’s collation of the <i>très-bon</i> with the <i>très-grand</i>
resembles the lines of Drummond’s hymn beginning,</p>

<p class="noindent">To us, as Sir Benjamin Brodie remarks, in one of his psychological
discussions, the universe presents itself as an assemblage
of heterogeneous phenomena, some of which we can reduce to
laws of limited operation, while others stand by themselves,
bearing no evident relation to anything besides. We may well,
he thinks, suppose that there are in the universe beings of a
superior intelligence, and possessed of a greater range of observation,
who are sufficiently “behind the scenes” to be able to
contemplate all the immense variety of material phenomena as
the result of one great general law. Their standpoint may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
enable them to see a Cosmos, a world of order, where to lower
intelligences Chaos alone is discernible, a world comparatively
without form and void, with darkness upon the face of its deep.
And as with the physical, so with the metaphysical. As with
the material, so with the moral.</p>

</div>

<p>When Israel went out of Egypt, it was under the
guidance of One whose hand being mighty to save,
the sea saw it, and fled; Jordan was driven back. “What
ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that
thou wast driven back?” The trembling was at the presence
of Him who hath placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by
a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it; and though the
waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail;
though they roar, yet can they not pass over it. The commotion,
the fleeing, the driving back, was at the bidding of Him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
who, and who alone, can say to the sea, Thus far shalt thou
come, and no farther; and here shall thy proud waves be
stayed.</p>

<p>The men of Galilee marvelled when, at the storm that once
arose on their sea, and the ship was in jeopardy, there arose
One who rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a
great calm. What manner of man was this, that even the
winds and the sea obeyed Him?</p>

<p>What manner of man? Be it legend or history, the story of
royal Cnut on the seashore, forbidding, at his flatterers’ instigation,
or by his own desire to rebuke their folly—forbidding
the farther approach of the incoming tide, is pregnant with
instruction on this head. The royal Dane might be a man of
men, but the surging waves were not obedient unto his voice.
King though he was, the tide was responseless as deaf adder
to any charming of his, charmed he never so wisely, enjoined
he never so straitly. What manner of man, then, but the Son
of man? What manner of king but the King of kings?</p>

<p>The Dane might have enforced the lesson on his parasites
by such a strain as that of a defeated monarch in Shakspeare:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent24">“Farewell king!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">How can you say to me I am a king?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A king, that is, in <i>their</i> sense of right Divine, and Divine
extent. So with poor, mad, discrowned Lear, drenched in that
terrible storm on the heath, and remembering soft speeches of
cozening courtiership, only of yesterday too. “When the rain
came to wet me, and the wind to make me chatter; when the
thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found them,
there I smelt them out. Go to, they are not men of their
words: they told me I was everything; ’tis a lie, I am not
ague-proof.” Mark, again, from the opening scene of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
“Tempest,” the rough, blunt, uncivil words with which the
boatswain cuts short the addresses of his royal passengers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hence! What care these roarers [the waves] for the name of king?
To cabin: silence: trouble us not.</p>

<p>“<i>Gonzalo.</i> Good; yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</p>

<p>“<i>Boatswain.</i> None that I love more than myself. You are a counsellor;
if you can command these elements to a silence, and work the peace of the
present [instant], we will not hand a rope more: use your authority. If
you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in
your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if so it hap. Cheerily, good
hearts.—Out of our way, I say!”</p>
</div>

<p>Of Antiochus Epiphanes, and his pride that had a fall, it is
written in the book of Maccabees: “And thus he that a little
afore thought he <i>might command the waves of the sea</i> (so proud
was he beyond the condition of man), and weigh the high
mountains in a balance, was now cast on the ground.”</p>

<p>An elder king than Cnut, and not a wiser, not only lashed
the winds that blew contrary to his will, but bound the sea with
fetters, after a sort:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ipsum compedibus qui vinxerat Ennosigæum.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Much good it did him: witness his return from his great
expedition, in a poor skiff, wind-tossed across waves red
with the blood of his slaughtered host, <i>cruentis fluctibus</i>. The
stars in their courses once fought against Sisera, and the
fettered waves were little more propitious to speed the fortunes
of Xerxes. He might have spared his chains. At any
rate he lost his army. Archdeacon Hare practically applied
the extravagance of the Great King, as they of Persia were
styled, in designating the present (or, rather, what was to him
the present) as an age when men will scoff at the madness of
Xerxes, yet themselves try to fling their chains over the ever-rolling,
irrepressible ocean of thought; nay, they will scoop
out a mimic sea in their pleasure-ground, he goes on to say,
and make it ripple and bubble, and spout up prettily into the
air, and then fancy that they are taming the Atlantic; which,
however, keeps advancing upon them, until it sweeps them
away with their toys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>It is edifying to read in the Diary of Mr. Pepys how, one
July afternoon, soon after the king had come back to enjoy his
own again, that gentleman went upon the river, but had to put
ashore and shelter himself from the rain that rained so hard;
during which time came by the king in his barge, going down
towards the Downs to meet the queen: “But methought it
lessened my esteem of a king, that he should not be able to
command the rain.”</p>

<p>Instructive, too, is the tenor of the legend of King Robert
of Sicily, which has been so attractively treated in prose by
Leigh Hunt, in his Jar of Honey from Mount Hybla, and in
verse by Professor Longfellow, in his Tales of a Wayside Inn.
There we read how the king with his nobles proudly sat at
vespers, on St. John’s Eve, and heard the priests chant the
Magnificat:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And, as he listened, o’er and o’er again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Repeated, like a burden or refrain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He caught the words, ‘<i>Deposuit potentes</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>De sede, et exaltavit humiles</i>;’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And slowly lifting up his kingly head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He to a learned clerk beside him said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘What mean these words?’ The clerk made answer meet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘He hath put down the mighty from their seat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hath exalted them of low degree.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis well that such seditious words are sung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only by priests, and in the Latin tongue;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For unto priests and people be it known</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is no power can push me from my throne!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sequel teaches him a different lesson, which he learns by
(and lays to) heart.</p>

<p>In those days, however, if any order of men might, or did,
claim authority over such turbulent subject-matter as the sea,
it was not kings, but priests. Ecclesiastical history relates the
calamitous visitation of earthquake and inundations by which
Epidaurus must once, and for ever, have been overwhelmed,
had not the prudent citizens placed St. Hilarion, an Egyptian
monk, on the beach. “He made the sign of the cross; the
mountain-wave stopped, bowed, and returned.” One’s respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
for the great qualities of the fearless Akbah, traversing the
wilds of Africa, and at length penetrating to the verge of the
Atlantic, is not lessened by what Gibbon relates of him:—that
his career, though not his zeal, being checked by the prospect
of a boundless ocean, Akbah spurred his horse into the waves,
and raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed with the tone of a
fanatic, “Great God, if my course were not stopped by this
sea, I would still go on, to the unknown kingdoms of the West,
preaching the unity of Thy holy name.” And the picture
reminds us of another, some eight centuries later, when Constantinople
was besieged and taken by Mahomet II., who, while
his ships were engaged against those of the Genoese, sat on
horseback on the beach, to encourage by voice and presence
the valour of the faithful: “The passions of his soul, and even
the gestures of his body, seemed to imitate the action of the
combatants; and, as if he had been the lord of nature, he
spurred his horse with a fearless and impotent effort into the
sea.” Sir Archibald Alison moralises on the spectacle of
Napoleon, in 1804, reviewing, or intending to review, the naval
force by which he designed to crush the British power: the
flotilla being tempest-tost when it hove in sight, and several
vessels stranded—an event “destined to teach the French
Emperor, like Canute the Dane, that there were bounds to his
power, and that his might was limited to the element on which
his army stood.” The sea—<i>c’est autre chose</i>.</p>

<p>It is of Tiberius, absolute master of the vastest, richest
empire ever seen under the sun, that an eminent French
preacher is treating when he says that an adulatory senator
kept repeating to him in every tone and accent that his
authority was without bounds. Tiberius would fain have
believed the assurance, if the illusion had been possible,—if he
had not felt himself at every instant <i>heurté contre une barrière
infranchissable</i>. The emperor’s flatterers had forgotten, for one
thing, to secure a peremptory decree against the inconvenient
limitation called time. His days were numbered. And in
vain Tiberius essayed to trick and elude death, and dissembled
with himself as to the stubborn fact of its resistless advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>Kings, great nobles, and the like, as a popular essayist
observes, have been known, even to the close of life, to
violently curse and swear, if things went against them; going
the length of stamping and blaspheming even at wind and rain,
and branches of trees and plashes of mud, for insubordination
and disrespect of persons. A popular novelist, again, having
to describe a fashionable wedding in the country on a portentously
wet and stormy day, makes the Lisford beadle, “who
was a sound Tory of the old school,” almost wonder that the
heavens themselves should be audacious enough to wet the
uncovered head of the lord of Jocelyn’s Rock. “But it went
on raining nevertheless.” It was in no such spirit that John
Bunyan once was all but resolved on putting to the test the
reality of his faith, by commanding some water puddles to be
dry.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyle made a picturesque application of the royal
Dane’s injunction to the waves, in his survey of the advancing
tide of the French Revolution—grim host marching on, the
black-browed Marseillese in the van, with hum and murmur,
far-heard; like the ocean-tide, “drawn up, as if by Luna and
Influences, from the great deep of waters, they roll gleaming
on; no king, Canute or Louis, can bid them roll back.” To
quite another effect is Judge Haliburton’s application of the
incident, in his panegyric on the capabilities of the Southampton
docks. It was here, he says, that Cnut sat in his arm-chair,
to show his courtiers (after he gave up drinking and murder)
that though he was a mighty prince, he could not control
the sea. “Well, what Canute could not do, your dock company
has accomplished. It has actually said to the sea,
‘Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther:’ and the waves have
obeyed the mandate.”</p>

<p>By poetical licence a Cornish poet of the present day ascribes
to his rock-bound coast a <i>ne plus ultra</i> control over an
ever-aggressive sea: he pictures the embattled advance of the
waves, and their discomfiture and retreat:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They come—they mount—they charge in vain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus far, incalculable main;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">No more! Thine hosts have not o’erthrown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lichen on the barrier stone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have the rocks faith that thus they stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unmoved, a grim and stately band,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And look, like warriors tried and brave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stern, silent, reckless, o’er the wave?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One, and one alone, is veritably the ruler of the waves.
When the floods are risen, when the floods have lift up their
voice, and lift up their waves, to Him only it pertaineth to still
their tumultuous clamour, and to level their aspiring crests.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly; yet the
Lord, who dwelleth on high, is mightier. “O Lord God of
hosts, who is like unto Thee?... Thou rulest the raging
of the sea: Thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.”</p>

<p>With a moral application we conclude, borrowed from one
whose was ever the pen of a ready writer to point a moral.
Some dream, says Cowper, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">... “they can silence when they will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The storm of passion, and say, ‘Peace, be still:’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ‘Thus far and no farther,’ when addressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the wild wave, or wilder human breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Implies authority that never can,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That never ought to be the lot of man.”</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IN_DEADLY_PERIL_UNAWARES"><i>IN DEADLY PERIL UNAWARES.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">1 Samuel</span> xxvi. 8-25.</p>

</div>

<p>Soundly the stalwart king of Israel slept within the
trench, while David and Abishai gazed on him by stealth
in the night-watches—his spear stuck in the ground at his
bolster, and Abner and the people lying round about him.
Abishai was for smiting him with the spear at once, promising
that once should be quite enough. Could David hesitate?
Was it not a special Providence? Had not God delivered his
enemy into his hand? Let but David give the word, the look,
the nod, and Abishai would at one fell swoop send Saul to his
account, with all his imperfections on his head. “Now, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the
earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.” But
David was inflexible in repudiating the regicide. Not for him
was it to stretch forth a hand against the Lord’s anointed.
So Saul slept on, and the shadow of death passed away. Unaware
of the peril that had approached him, his awaking was
an ordinary awaking. But, to convict the watchers of unwatchfulness,
if not to convince the king of a narrow escape
and a generous foe, David took the spear and the cruse of
water from Saul’s bolster; and he and his companion gat
them away unperceived—for no man saw it, nor knew it,
neither awaked; for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep
from the Lord was fallen upon them. Anon David roused the
host with the story of that narrow escape, charging Abner with
criminal neglect worthy of death. And as he recited the story,
Saul was touched; and there was emotion in his voice and in
his words when he felt what the peril had been, and knew
whom he had to thank for its harmless issue.</p>

<p>Had we eyes sharp enough, observes Cowper in a letter to
Hayley, we should see the arrows of death flying in all directions,
and account it a wonder that we and our friends escape
them but a single day. Many years previously the poet had
written to the same effect to Unwin,—that could we see at a
glance of the eye what is passing every day upon all the roads
in the kingdom, we should indeed find reason to be thankful
for journeys performed in safety, and for deliverance from
dangers we are not perhaps even permitted to see. “When in
some of the high southern latitudes, and in a dark tempestuous
night, a flash of lightning discovered to Captain Cook a vessel
which glanced along close by his side, and which but for the
lightning he must have run foul of, both the danger and the
transient light that showed it were undoubtedly designed,” as
Cowper is devoutly convinced, “to convey to him this wholesome
instruction, that a particular Providence attended him,
and that he was not only preserved from evils of which he had
notice, but from many more of which he had no information or
even the least suspicion.” It is noticeable, as Mr. de Quincey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
points out, that a danger which approaches, but wheels away—which
threatens, but finally forbears to strike—is more interesting
by much on a distant retrospect than the danger
which accomplishes its mission. “The Alpine precipice, down
which many pilgrims have fallen, is passed without much attention;
but that precipice, within one inch of which a traveller has
passed unconsciously in the dark, first tracing his peril along
the snowy margin on the next morning, becomes invested with
an attraction of horror for all who hear the story.” In another
of his books, and the most celebrated of them all, the same
impassioned master of English prose, recites the thoughts that
arose within him, at a crisis in his youthful life, on the suggestive
opening of that beautiful collect, “Lighten our darkness,
we beseech thee, O Lord!” in which the great shadows of
night are made symbolically significant—those great powers,
night and darkness, that belong to aboriginal chaos, being
made representative of the perils that, unseen, continually
menace poor afflicted human nature. “With deepest sympathy
I accompanied the prayer against the perils of darkness,—perils
that I seemed to see, in the ambush of midnight
solitude, brooding around the beds of sleeping nations;
perils from even worse forms of darkness shrouded within the
recesses of blind human hearts; perils from temptations weaving
unseen snares for our footing.” As Marcello has it, in Beddoes’
tragedy,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Each minute of man’s safety he does walk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A bridge, no thicker than his frozen breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er a precipitous and craggy danger</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yawning to death!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With admirable subtlety and suggestiveness, Mr. Hawthorne
illustrates this subject in that <i>fantasiestück</i> of his, called “David
Swan.” A young man of that name falls asleep on the roadside,
of a summer’s day, and <i>we</i> see, what he sees not, nor
dreams of happening to him, a series of incidents that go near
to alter the current of his being, and very near, in one instance,
to stop altogether its earthly course. When he awakes from
that sound sleep, and hies him cheerily homeward, he knows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
not, nor ever will know, in this world at least, that while he
slumbered, all in one brief hour, wealth was all but made over
to him by one heirless passer-by, and death all but dealt him
by two reckless ruffians. They were interrupted, and left him,
and he never was to know of the narrow escape. The moral
of the fantasy is, that sleeping or waking, we hear not the
airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen. And
the moralist’s query ensues, Does it not argue a superintending
Providence, that while viewless and unexpected events thrust
themselves continually athwart our path, there should still be
regularity enough in mortal life to render foresight even partially
available?</p>

<p>The moral of “David Swan” is implicitly conveyed in that
passage in “Waverley” which relates Colonel Gardiner’s unconscious
escape from the raised and pointed weapon of the
Highlander, Callum Beg. An incident that appeals to his
superstition makes the intending slayer drop his piece; and
“Colonel Gardiner,” we read, “unconscious of the danger he
had escaped, turned his horse round, and rode slowly back to
the front of his regiment.”</p>

<p>So with Mrs. Hilyard, in “Salem Chapel,” on the evening of
the secret interview upon the chapel steps. A hidden witness
there is of that interview, who, however, sees not the gesture
of her companion which bodes, and almost involves, a fatal,
a murderous issue. “But even Mrs. Hilyard herself never
knew how near, how very near, she was at that moment to the
unseen world.”</p>

<p>To Cremona went together, in seeming amity, the Emperor
Sigismund and Pope John XXIII., and there an incident had
nearly taken place, which, as the historian of Latin Christianity
says, might, by preventing the Council of Constance,
have changed the fortunes of the world. Gabrino Fondoli,
who from podestâ had become tyrant of Cremona, “entertained
his distinguished guests with sumptuous hospitality.
He led them up the lofty tower to survey the rich and spacious
plains of Lombardy. On his deathbed Fondoli confessed the
sin, of which he deeply repented, that he resisted the temptation,
and had not hurled pope and emperor down, and so
secured himself an immortal name.” Pope and emperor on
the tower-top were as little inclined to suspect how closely the
shadow of death was then and there overshadowing them, as
they would have been able to comprehend the ultimate repentance
of the intending murderer, not for having intended murder,
but for having not carried his intention out.</p>

<p>It is one of Young’s night thoughts that “the farthest from
the fear, are often nearest to the stroke of fate.” Often the
stroke menaces them unawares, but after all is not dealt; and
to the last they are unaware that on such a day, and at such a
minute, there was but a step between them and death.</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Mark</span> vi. 31.</p>

</div>

<p>That must have been a busy time with the apostles,
careful and troubled about many things, cumbered with
much serving, worn with many anxieties, and kept in unrest by
continual demands on their services, when the Divine Master—knowing
their frame and remembering that they were dust—bade
them come by themselves “apart into a desert place, and
rest a while; for there were many coming and going, and they
had <i>no leisure</i> so much as to eat.”</p>

<p>Our own age has been rightly described as one of stimulus
and high pressure: we live as it were our lives out fast; effect
is everything; results produced at once; something to show,
and something that may <i>tell</i>. “The folio of patient years is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
replaced by the pamphlet that stirs men’s curiosity to-day, and
to-morrow is forgotten.” Or as an eminent reviewer puts it—writing
to the same effect as the eminent divine just quoted—without
grudging to contemporary productions the applause
which they receive, or the interest which they excite, thoughtful
minds cannot see them with complacency obscuring by their
brilliance, or perhaps their “glare,” the more temperate and
wholesome light of the elder classics of our land. “At no
moment in the intellectual progress of England has repose ever
been more needful, if the literature of the present century be
to take its place among its great antecessors.” For want of
repose our prose is declared on the same authority to be growing
turgid, our verse empty or inflated; and as a good cooling
regimen is required to correct these exorbitances, nothing would
rejoice our censor more than to be assured, on the credit of
sound publishers’ statistics, that the number of new books was
diminishing, while that of re-editions of old books was on the
increase. Dr. Arnold, we are told, once preached a sermon to
the boys at Rugby against taking in the monthly numbers of
“Nicholas Nickleby,” by way of protest against systematic and
uninterrupted excitement. “Society keeps up as much excitement
as it can. It wants its new number of something to
appear incessantly. There is no rest or repose, and one subject
of thought succeeds another faster than wave succeeds wave.”
A rather ironical apology for dull sermons sets up at least this
plea in their behalf: that so easy is it for a man who lives in
such a society never to be alone with himself, that a compulsory
half-hour of quietude at a wakeful time of the day, in a
place which recalls to him the most solemn thoughts, is no
slight advantage.</p>

<p>La Bruyère, two centuries ago, complained of French society
in his day, that there was no getting any one to abide quietly
at home, and there in patience possess his soul, and make sure
to himself that he had one. All was hurry and flurry. Not to
be excitedly busy was to be idle. But that the philosopher
denied. A wise man turns his leisure to account. He is not
idle who devotes his leisure to tranquil meditation, and converse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
and reading. Rather is this a species of work—at any
rate a means for working with fresh energy and better effect
when the working hour comes round again. There is such a
thing as what Wordsworth wisely calls a wise passiveness.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand, again, more than a century afterwards, complained—not
indeed of Frenchmen alone, but of all men—that
all was done helter-skelter and in haste, post-haste; that amid
this din and distraction of coming and going there was no
leisure so much as to eat; or that if men did set about a meal,
there was no such thing as sitting down to it, but it was
eaten by them with their loins girded, their shoes on their
feet, and their staff in their hand—eaten in haste, as was the
Jewish passover.</p>

<p>The most eminent political economist of our day owns himself
to be “not charmed” with the ideal of life held out by
those who think that the normal state of human beings is that
of struggling to get on; that the trampling, crushing, elbowing,
and treading on one another’s heels, which form the existing
type of social life, are the most desirable lot of human kind,
or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases
of industrial progress. The town, complains one of the most
thoughtful and influential of latter-day divines,—the town, with
its fever and its excitements, and its collision of mind with
mind, has spread over the country, and there is no country,
scarcely home. “To men who traverse England in a few
hours, and spend only a portion of the year in one place, home
is becoming a vocable of past ages.” He echoes Wordsworth’s
lament that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Plain living and high thinking are no more;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in another place he declares our want to be the vision of a
calmer and simpler beauty, to tranquillise us in the midst of
artificial tastes, and the draught of a purer spring to cool the
flame of our excited life. It is many years ago since the most
genial of essayists avowed his preference for “coaching it,” and
could have been well content to live upon the road, in those
roomy antiques, instead of getting on at the present rate, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
being impatient to arrive at some town, only perhaps to be
equally restless when arrived there. Not that he was insensible
to the pleasure of driving fast—stirring the blood as it
does, and giving a sense of power; but he complained that
everything was getting a little too hasty and business-like, “as
though we were to be eternally getting on, and never realizing
anything but fidget and money—the means instead of the end.”
A distinction is duly recognised between haste and hurry—hurry
adding to rapidity the element of painful confusion; but
in the case of ordinary people, as Dr. Boyd observes, haste
generally implies hurry, and very strenuously he dilates on
“what a horrible thing” it must be to go through life in a
hurry. The self-styled country parson made a name (“letters
four do make that name”) by his “Recreations.” And he has
since then maintained its popularity by a series of “Leisure
Hours.” In his essay concerning Hurry and Leisure he avows
his utter contempt for the idler—the loafer, as Yankees term
him—who never does anything, whose idle hands are always
in his idle pockets, and who is always sauntering to and fro.
Leisure, we are reminded, is the intermission of labour—the
blink of idleness in the life of a hard-working man; and it is
only in the case of such a man that leisure is allowed to be
dignified, commendable, or enjoyable. “But to him it is all
these, and more. Let us not be ever driving on. The machinery,
physical and mental, will not stand it.” Only in
leisure, it is further contended, will the human mind yield
many of its best products. Calm views, sound thoughts,
healthful feelings, do not originate in a hurry or a fever.</p>

<p>It was in wistful remembrance of the silence in heaven for
the space of half an hour, as recorded by the Seer of Patmos,
that Mrs. Browning penned a sonnet which expressed a prayer,
suggestive in its earnestness and of wide application,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Vouchsafe us such a half-hour’s hush alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In compensation for our stormy years!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Never to be forgotten amid the tranquillising sweets of leisure
hours, with healing on their wings, is the serene solemnity of
that silent half-hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>Professor Longfellow, in one of his earliest works, proclaimed
to his countrymen as the great want of the national character,
that of the “dignity of repose.” “We seem,” he said, “to live
in the midst of a battle—there is such a din, such a hurrying
to and fro. In the streets of a crowded city it is difficult to
walk slowly. You feel the rushing of the crowd, and rush with
it onward. In the press of our life, it is difficult to be calm.
In this stress of wind and tide, all professions seem to drag
their anchors, and are swept out into the main.” The following
stanza is so thoroughly conceived in the spirit and expressed
in the style of the same author—the author of the
“Psalm of Life”—that few readers might have hesitated to
attribute it to him, were it not known to be from one of the
“Palm Leaves” of Lord Houghton, who, a quarter of a century
ago, as Richard Monckton Milnes, after contrasting the din,
and stir, and turmoil of the West with the reposeful air of the
East, counselled the poet of the West to wander eastward now
and then:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There the calm of life comparing</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With his Europe’s busy fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let him gladly homeward faring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Learn to labour and to wait.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps the most gifted of American writers of fiction
to whom we owe the avowal, that were he to adopt a pet idea,
as so many people do, and fondle it in his embraces to the
exclusion of all others, it would be that the great want which
mankind labours under at this present period is—sleep. The
world, he urges, should recline its vast head on the first
convenient pillow, and take a prolonged nap. It has gone
distracted, on his showing, through a morbid activity, and
while preternaturally wide awake, is nevertheless tormented by
visions that seem real to it now, but would assume their true
aspect and character were all things once set right by an
interval of sound repose. This he declares to be the only
method of getting rid of old delusions and of avoiding new
ones—of restoring to us the simple perception of what is right,
and the single-hearted desire to achieve it, both of which have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
long been lost in consequence of this weary activity of brain
and torpor or passion of the heart that now afflict the universe.
“Stimulants, the only mode of treatment hitherto attempted,
cannot quell the disease; they do but heighten the delirium.”
Sleep, therefore, is the panacea he prescribes for the physical
and metaphysical regeneration of our race, so that it may in
due time awake, as an infant out of dewy slumber.</p>

<p>To the like effect protests an able essayist of our day against
tendencies to overrate the endless facilities of speedy locomotion
now enjoyed, as if they were a boon without a drawback;
and he professes not to regard as particularly attractive or
elevating the sight of mankind scouring and bustling endlessly
hither and thither over the face of the earth, like eager,
energetic ants, with little bits of straw or other rubbish packed
on their heads. Ought we not rather, it is asked, to look on
tranquillity, and equilibrium, and regularity, as the normal condition
of things? and in the thousand encomiums which are
poured forth upon steam and speed, do we often take into
account the waste and havoc which they make in “plain
living”—how they practically shorten the days of a man?</p>

<p>The haste and hurry of modern English civilization, it has
been elsewhere observed, ever increasing and carrying us more
impetuously forward, tend to deaden all capacity for simpler
enjoyments, and all sense of the worth of a tranquil life on
which the eyes of all the world are not fixed. And whenever,
as a reflective discourser remarks, people set their heads to
constant work, we may be perfectly certain that they are
losing more than they gain, and are sinking in the scale at
once of meditative and social beings. The accomplished
author of an essay on Leisure—the cultivation of which as an
art is thought to be in danger of dying out amongst us—says
of that activity which never relaxes sufficiently to allow time
for a calm and more or less passive contemplation of life as a
whole, that it is “apt to degenerate into mere hand-to-mouth
fussiness or drudgery, and can be justified only by necessity.”
The very repose of leisure is accordingly pronounced a by no
means purely selfish enjoyment—it being one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
communicable, nay, contagious, of pleasures; for there are
people, we are reminded, whose company is as restful as sleep,
in whose presence hurry seems like a bad dream when it is
past, and whom one leaves with a sense of refreshment and
renewed energy such as is produced by a good night’s rest.
And this writer contends that to afford such refreshment to
others may often be turning time to better account than to
crowd it with self-chosen business. Not that the fact is not
duly insisted upon that too little work is as fatal as too much
to that lightness and alacrity of spirit which are needed for the
conversion of spare time into hours of leisure worthy to be
so called. Some natures, indeed, and they are of a high order,
sometimes of the highest, find one leisure hour at a time as
much as they can away with, and anon</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nay something better and more abiding than that.</p>

<p>But to conclude. The notion, as expounded by an essayist
on “Short Cuts,” that if a thing is to be done at all, “then
’twere well it were done quickly,” admirable as it may be on
the Exchange, is justly said to rub the delicacy and bloom off
life when it is made the ruling maxim in all other relations and
positions: a life with leisure hours in it for watching and
examining all that we pass being a much more enviable and
rational lot than a swift rushing from one goal to another, from
one sort of fame or power or opulence to another and more
remote. When the ambitious hero in Sir Henry Taylor’s
dramatic poem declares in the storm and stress of his career,</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> xxiii. 2.</p>

</div>

<p>King Solomon’s discreet counsel to him that feasts with
royalty, to put a knife to his throat, if he be a man given
to appetite, may be advantageously enlarged in its application
to diners-out, or for the matter of that, to diners at home, all
and sundry. Sitting to eat with a ruler, the guest is admonished
to consider diligently what is before him; and at the same time
to be not desirous of the great man’s dainties, for they are
deceitful meat. Any and every man given to appetite will do
well to chew the cud of this bitter fancy; and the prophylactic
application of a knife to the throat, forbidding rash ingress and
intemperate speed of swallow, is wholesome for all estates and
degrees of men among us, and might beneficially be a standing
order for all times.</p>

<p>Adam Smith, in his “Theory of the Moral Sentiments,” calls
it “indecent” to express any strong degree of those passions
which arise from a certain situation or disposition of the body;
because the company, not being in the same disposition,
cannot be expected to sympathize with them; and he mentions
violent hunger as being, though upon many occasions not only
natural, but unavoidable, yet “always indecent; and to eat
voraciously is universally regarded as a piece of ill manners.”
There is, however, he allows, some degree of sympathy, even
with hunger, and we may add, even on the part of a ruler at whose
table sits the man given to appetite. Lewis the Fourteenth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
himself a gourmand, and, which is different, an enormous eater,
liked to see a dinner guest disposing wholesale of the royal
cates, if only by way of keeping himself in countenance, while
achieving the like result. Royalty has, indeed, again and again
been addicted to surfeiting, and sometimes of a memorably
fatal sort. Alexander Jannæus died of gluttony, during the
siege of Ragaba. Soliman, the seventh khalif of the race of the
Ommiyades, died of a surfeit at Chalcis, in Syria, while preparing
to lead an army to Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Of the emperor
Jovian, we read in Gibbon, that one night, at the obscure town
Dadastana, after indulging himself with a redundant supper, he
retired to rest, and was next morning found dead in his bed—an
event ascribed by some, though not by all, to the quality of
the mushrooms, <i>plus</i> the quantity of wine, which he had swallowed
in the evening. The same historian rather more than
suspects that the mortal disease of Athanaric the Goth “was
contracted amidst the pleasures of the imperial banquets,” by
Theodosius provided. Pope Benedict XI. is said to have died
of a surfeit of fruit—some beautiful fresh figs, of which he was
very fond, being offered to him in a silver basin by a veiled
novice, as if from the abbess of the convent of St. Petronilla,
in Perugia: “The pope, not suspecting a gift from such a hand,
ate them eagerly, and without having them previously tasted.”
That he died of poison, few in that age, as Milman says, would
venture to doubt, but the poisoning power of arrears of undigested
food has never been quite rated at its full value. The
same hesitation between fruit surfeit and poison, obtains in the
case of King John, whose death, by one account due to the
fatal drug administered by a Cistercian monk, by another is
attributed to an intemperate indulgence at supper in fruit and
new cider. The Emperor Frederick III. contracted his last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
illness, some say, by a surfeit of melons. And is there not, in
the case of our Henry I., what has been called that tale of royal
excess so concisely and pathetically told in nursery history?
“He never smiled again, and died of a surfeit of lampreys.”
The <i>regicide</i> lampreys, Moore calls them in one place; and in
another, after citing Hume’s remark on them, as “a food which
always agreed better with his [Henry’s] palate than his constitution,”
a dish so indigestible, that a late novelist, at the end of
his book, could imagine no more summary mode of getting rid
of all his heroes and heroines than by a hearty supper of stewed
lampreys. In yet another the same squib-writer has a cruel
simile, “just as honest King Stephen his beaver might doff to
the fishes that carried his kind uncle off.” To a surfeit of red
herrings is ascribed the death of Robert Greene, the dramatist.
The trap for the life of the Emperor Antoninus Pius was baited,
as De Quincey expresses it, with toasted cheese. Kaiser Karl
VI. was the victim of a voracious repast on mushrooms stewed
in oil.</p>

<p>When Hadrian found his illness on the increase, and his end
approaching, he removed to Baiæ, where, “in spite of the
prescriptions [or proscriptions?] of his physicians, he began to
eat and drink according to his pleasure.” The excesses of
Charles V. in the same way are exceptionally notorious. Of
that “little, spare, aguish, peevish, supper-eating” sovereign,
Frederick the Great, who loved his dishes the more they tormented
him, it is on record, that on the approach of death,
“this warrior full of courage and sage speculation,” could not
resist the customary pepper and sauce piquante, though he
knew it would inevitably result in a nightmare, “turning his
bed into a nest of monsters.” So with the Duke Augustus
commemorated by Perthes: “All medical skill was in vain, for
this half crazy prince could not deny himself the stimulus of the
hottest spices.” Mr. Tennyson’s dying Northern Farmer is
only too true a type of his kind:—</p>

<p class="noindent">Swift is giving Pope a significant and not uncalled-for hint,
when he writes to express his uneasiness at ever hearing of the
poet’s being out to dinner: “For the least transgression of
yours, if it be only two bits and one sup more than your stint,
is a great debauch; for which you certainly pay more than
those sots who are carried dead drunk to bed.” An entry in
Mrs. Trench’s diary begins, “Dined at the Duke of Queensberry’s.
He is very ill—has a violent cough, but <i>will</i> eat an
immense dinner, and then complains of a <i>digestion pénible</i>.”
Another of his quality has been described as taking all sorts of
pains to get a little enjoyment which must produce for him a
world of misery. “One of his passions which he <i>will</i> not resist,
is for a particular dish, pungent, savoury, and multifarious,
which sends him almost every night into Tartarus.” Mr.
Thackeray’s moribund old Madame Bernstein <i>will</i> have her
supper luxurious, “nor could any injunction of ours or the
doctor’s teach her abstinence.” The Sir Miles St. John of
another popular fiction does himself to death after the same
manner: “He would have his own way; and he contrived to coax
or to force his doctor into an authority on his side.” For
doctors are not all of the kind that Sancho Panza had to deal
with when governor of Barataria. <i>The Doctor</i> cites the case of
an eminent member of “the faculty,” who could never refrain
from eating toasted cheese, though he was subject to an alarming
pulmonary complaint which was uniformly aggravated by it,
and which terminated fatally at an age by no means advanced.
Another he relates, of a physician who, at an autumnal dessert
never ceased eating all the filberts he could lay his hands upon,
while candidly acknowledging what indigestible and hurtful
things they were.</p>

<p>Not a doctor apparently of medicine, but (<i>proh pudor!</i>) of
divinity, was that Cambridge don of whose end Gray makes
memorable mention, as having gone to his grave with five fine
mackarel (large and full of roe) in his inside. “He ate them
all off at one dinner; but his fate was a turbot on Trinity Sunday,
of which he left little for the company besides bones. He
had not been hearty all the week; but after this sixth fish he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
never held up his head more.” Like Milton’s Eve, in one sense
at least:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Greedily he ingorged without restraint,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And knew not eating death.”</div>

</div>

<p>Dr. Johnson’s friend, Thrale, is a noteworthy example, or
warning, of the man of appetite, who <i>will not</i> restrain it; will
not put a knife to his throat, but prefers sending a full laden
fork in that direction. His wife describes his natural disposition
to conviviality as degenerating into a preternatural desire
for food. “No one could control his appetite.” “Burney and
I and Queeney tease him every meal he eats, and Mrs. Montagu
is quite serious with him; but what <i>can</i> one do? He will
eat, I think; and if he does eat, I know he will not live.” The
lampreys that were one too many for Henry the king, were one
too many for Thrale the brewer. He begged some of an old
friend, and the old friend complied, despite the frowns and
negative signals of the ladies of the house—whom following out
of the room, the too compliant visitor thus made his apology
to Mrs. Thrale, “I understand you, Madam, but <i>must</i> disobey.
A friend I have known thirty-six years shall not ask a favour of
me in his last stage of life and be refused. What difference
can it make?” Tears stood in <i>his</i> eyes, and Mrs. Thrale’s own—<i>les
larmes dans la voix</i>—prevented all reply. What difference
did it make? That day was Mr. Thrale’s last. The tone of
the apology reminds us of General Paoli’s answer to Boswell,
when whispering his fear lest Johnson, very aged and very
ailing, might be hurt by the amount and variety of what he was
despatching at the general’s table, “where he loved to dine.”
Boswell begged Paoli not to press him. Why urge a too willing
horse? “Alas!” said the host, “see how very ill he looks:
he can live but a very short time. Would you refuse a slight
gratification to a man under sentence of death?” And the
general cited approvingly the “humane custom” in Italy, by
which those in Johnson’s position were indulged with having
whatever they liked best to eat and drink, even with expensive
delicacies. A parallel case we have in Sir Walter Scott,
during his melancholy sojourn in Italy, as Sir W. Gell describes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
his dining at a Roman palace, and his own fears lest, from the
hospitality of the Torlonia family, and “with servants on all
sides pressing him to eat and drink, as is their custom at Rome,”
Sir Walter might be induced to eat more than was safe for his
malady. “Colonel Blair, who sat next him, was requested to
take care that this should not happen. Whenever I observed
him, however, Sir Walter appeared always to be eating; while
the duchess, who had discovered the nature of the office imposed
on the colonel, was by no means satisfied, and after
dinner observed that it was an odd sort of friendship which
consisted in starving one’s neighbour to death, when he had a
good appetite, and there was dinner enough.”</p>

<p>The selfish club-man <i>par excellence</i> has been depicted as
earthing himself from pursuit in the sanctuary of his club,
there to eat his fill unmolested, with no remonstrant at hand to
remind him of the gout when enjoying his turtle, or to talk of
cupping when the glass of champagne is at his lips. “There
he may eat his asparagus <i>tout à l’huile</i>—there he may pepper
his cream-tart,” and none to say him nay. Drawn with pitiless
realism from the life is Acton Bell (Anne Brontè)’s picture of
the dying master of Wildfell Hall, whose extreme dread of
death, when and while it seems imminent, renders easy his
wife’s task of curbing his unruly greed, but who becomes intractable
as the danger to dear life seems receding. “I watch and
restrain him,” she writes, “as well as I can, and often get bitterly
abused for my rigid severity; and sometimes he contrives
to elude my vigilance, and sometimes acts in opposition to my
will.” William Collins, the painter, notes in his diary a certain
“dinner at C⸺’s,” where he “sat next to H⸺, who took
some highly seasoned omelet. I asked him how he could
venture on such stuff; he said he could not resist it, though
he knew how much he should suffer from it. He took a great
deal of wine, to overcome the effects of the omelet, and assured
me he should be ill for four days after such a dinner, and that
he always suffered in the same way after dining with C⸺!
How absurd such weakness appears, and yet how common it
is!” George Herbert’s counsel is never out of date, any more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
than King Solomon’s, in the matter of putting a knife to one’s
throat, if edacious and a diner-out:—</p>

<p>Why wept Elisha in the presence of Hazael, when that
envoy from the sick king of Syria courted the man of
God, in his sovereign’s behalf, with a consignment of every good
thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden? Courteous and gentle
was Benhadad’s messenger who came to inquire of the Lord of
Elisha, if the royal Syrian should recover of the disease which
had brought him so low. Why wept the prophet, when his
prophecy had been uttered, ominously vague? “Go, say unto
him [Benhadad], Thou mayest certainly recover. Howbeit the
Lord hath showed me that he shall certainly die.” And he
settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed.</p>

<p>“And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered,
Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of
Israel; their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young
men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children,”
etc. And Hazael said, “But what! is thy servant a
dog, that he should do this great thing?”</p>

<p>Yet Hazael went home, and on the very morrow commenced
his justification of the seer’s previsionary tears, by spreading a
thick wet cloth on the face of his master, so that Benhadad,
who else would have recovered, died, and Hazael reigned in his
stead.</p>

<p>Well might the man of God weep, nor could anything be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
more natural, or at least naturally assumed, than the shuddering
repudiation, the deprecating protest, of the envoy that now was,
the king—and dog—that to-morrow should be.</p>

<p>The man who is weak, observes Miss Lee in the “Canterbury
Tales,” is always in danger of becoming a villain; and
she exemplifies this liability in the instance of Villars, who, by
indulging a passion calculated to enfeeble his understanding
and corrupt his heart, is soon to be found touching that point
which his high tone of romantic refinement had once induced
him to believe it impossible he should even approach. But he
protests too much who strenuously protests, with protestation
heaped on protestation, against any such possible lapse and collapse
on his part; and there are cases of this kind, of which
one may say with Molière—</p>

<p>Martial is in the right in answering the inquiry of Priscus,
how would he live if he became rich and great all at once, with
another query, Who can say beforehand what his future conduct

Priscus were to become a lion, what sort of one would he turn
out to be? Perhaps like Hazael, a dog.</p>

<p>In sight of a corpse suspended to a tree, the “miserable

<p>Dr. Hamilton somewhere adverts to a sort of gambling in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
our large cities which does not look particularly repulsive—not
being carried on in “hells,” and pleading the sanction of some
titled names; the results, however, of which are hanging like a
millstone round the neck of many a once promising young man;
while, to say nothing of those whom it has reduced to beggary
or blackguardism, numbers of its victims must be sought in the
Portland hulks or Dartmoor prison. “They went to the race-course,
or, without going there, they laid wagers on horses, and
sooner or later they lost more than they could pay, and in dread
of dishonour they took means to get the money at the very
suggestion of which, once upon a time, they would indignantly
have exclaimed, ‘Is thy servant a dog?’ and after a few miserable
makeshifts, only adding sin to sin, there came detection and
ruin and disgrace.” It is of the riotous living of prodigal sons
that the same preacher is treating, when he shows, in his
graphic way, how speedily riot, whether coarse or refined, wastes
the reveller’s substance—not only sapping the constitution, and
softening the brain, and shattering the nerves, and enfeebling
the mind, but exhausting the estate, and soon bringing the
spendthrift to poverty. And, as the discourser goes on to say,
if the passion still urges, and the fear of God has departed,
wild methods will be used to meet the demand and assuage the
frantic craving. “Keepsakes will be sold or pledged, to part
with which would, once upon a time, have looked like sacrilege.”
Perhaps money will be taken from the till, and so on
and on, or rather downwards and downwards, deeper and
deeper, till the lowest deep is sounded, and darkness is the
burier of the dead.</p>

<p>It has been remarked by one of the most reflective of our
popular authors, that there is a terrible coercion in our deeds
which may first turn the honest man into a deceiver, and then
reconcile him to the change, for this reason—that the second
wrong presents itself to him in the guise of the only practicable
right. “The action which before commission has been
seen with that blended common-sense and fresh untarnished
feeling which is the healthy eye of the soul, is looked at afterwards
with the lens of apologetic ingenuity, through which all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
things that men call beautiful and ugly are seen to be made
up of textures very much alike.” Europe, it is suggestively
added, adjusts itself to a <i>fait accompli</i>; and so does an individual
character—until the placid adjustment is disturbed by a
convulsive retribution.</p>

<p>Recording the appointment of Bonaparte to succeed Scherer
in command of the French forces on Genoese territory, Southey
observes that although the former had given indications of his
military talents at Toulon, and of his remorseless nature at
Paris, “the extent either of his ability or his wickedness was
at this time known to none, and perhaps not even suspected by
himself.” Of all the lessons derived from the history of human
passion, says Lavalette, the most important is the utter impossibility
which even the best men will always experience of
stopping, if they are once led into the path of error. If, a few
years before they were perpetrated, the crimes of the first
French Revolution, he goes on to surmise, could have been
portrayed to those who committed them, “even Robespierre
himself would have recoiled with horror.” Men, in the case
suggested, are seduced at first by plausible theories, which
their heated imaginations represent as beneficial and easy of
execution: “they advance unconsciously from errors to faults,
and from faults to crimes, till sensibility is destroyed by the
habitual spectacle of guilt, and the most savage atrocities come
to be dignified by the name of state policy.”</p>

<p>The world, and the spirit of the world, observes Sir Fowell
Buxton in one of his letters, are very insidious; “and more
than once I have seen a person who, as a youth, was single-eyed
and single-hearted, and who, to any one who supposed he might
glide into laxity of zeal, would have said, ‘Am I a dog?’ in
maturer age become, if not a lover of the vices of the world, at
least a tolerator of its vanities.” But as M. de Sainte-Beuve
sententiously puts it, in one of his maxims after the manner of
La Rochefoucauld, “La plupart des défauts qui éclatent dans
la seconde moitié de la vie existaient en nous tout formés bien
auparavant; mais ils étaient masqués, en quelque sorte, par la
pudeur de la jeunesse.” The faults of after-life were there, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
only the modest reserve and self-restraint of youth kept them
under cover. With riper years comes less regard for others,
and the cover is taken off.</p>

<p>A clerical essayist on “Future Years,” “can well believe,” he
tells us, “that many a man, could he have a glimpse in innocent
youth of what he will be twenty or thirty years after, would
pray in anguish to be taken before coming to <i>that</i>!” “Mansie
Wauch’s glimpse of destitution was bad enough; but a million
times worse is a glimpse of hardened and unabashed sin and
shame.” And it would be no comfort, we are reminded—it
would be an aggravation in that view—to think that by the
time you have reached that miserable point, you will have
grown pretty well reconciled to it—<i>that</i> being the worst of all.</p>

<p>Hazael stands out in large type, black letter type, or red
letter, if you will—the hue of blood—a degraded instance of the
degrading power of guilt—a warning of the stealthy yet swift
aggression of criminal impulse, or criminal policy, seducing,
subduing, and transforming its subjects,—</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> vi. 3.</p>

</div>

<p>To some of us, to very many, it may seem that the Sermon
might well be on a Mount, that set forth such a text as this:
“But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what
thy right hand doeth.” The atmosphere is of other altitudes
than here below. We may not sound a trumpet before us, as
the hypocrites did in the synagogue and in the streets, to have
glory of men; and verily, every man his own trumpeter, they
had their reward. But as to keeping our open-handed doles
and donations a secret, as it were, from our other self; as to
concealing from the left hand the furtive bounties and stealthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
almsgiving of the right, that is a practical transcendentalism
mostly undreamt of in our philosophy.</p>

<p>Yet are there, and ever will be, those—else had this earth of
ours lost the salt of the earth, and wherewith then should it be
salted?—who—</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The larger number of benefactors, who, as the caustic French
wit, Chamfort, puts it, pretend to conceal themselves after
effecting a deed of kindness, betake themselves to flight and a
hiding-place only as Virgil’s Galatea did, with a decided wish
to be seen first: <i>Et se cupit ante videri.</i> Another of Chamfort’s
cynical <i>maximes et pensées</i> runs thus: “Il y a peu de bienfaiteurs
qui ne disent comme Satan, <i>Si cadens adoraveris me</i>.” Whom the
vulgar succour, they oppress, says Crabbe. They have as little
sympathy with, or interest in, the rule of keeping the right
hand’s largesse a secret from the left, as with Peter of Aragon’s
famous refusal to let Pope Martin IV know what were his
designs against the infidel. Peter implored the blessing of
the Holy Father on his scheme of action; “but if he thought
his right hand knew his secret, he would cut it off, lest it
should betray it to his left.” And the vulgar mean the commonalty,
the many, the <i>polloi</i>. The doer of good, therefore,
who does it by stealth, is the exception to a rule; and as an
exception he is treated in literature and life as what is called
a “character.” Goldsmith makes a highly pronounced character
of his man in black, whose hand is open as day to melting
charity, while he professes to keep it closed tight as wax and
hard as steel. He bullies in words a petitioner for aid, while
he is but studying what method he shall take to relieve him
unobserved. “He had, however,” writes the Chinese citizen
of the world, “no easy part to act, as he was obliged to preserve
the appearance of ill-nature before me, and yet relieve
himself by relieving the sailor.” And by contrivance he gains
his end. The mandarin’s curiosity to know “what could be
his motives for thus concealing virtues which others take such
pains to display,” is natural, and finds natural expression; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
thereby hangs the tale of the “reluctantly good” Man in
Black. Smollett, again, makes one of his heroes, though young
and pleasure-loving, retrench his expenses in order to help the
needy: “Numberless were the objects to which he extended
his charity in private. Indeed, he exerted this virtue in secret,
not only on account of avoiding the charge of ostentation, but
also because he was ashamed of being detected in such an
awkward, unfashionable practice by the censorious observers of
this humane generation. In this particular he seemed to confound
the ideas of virtue and vice; for he did good as other
people do evil, by stealth; and was [like the man in black] so
capricious in point of behaviour, that frequently, in public, he
wagged his tongue in satirical animadversions upon that poverty
which his hand had, in private, relieved.” It cannot be affirmed
of him that he exemplified, in detail, all the attributes of a
portrait from life, but after death, by Cowper; but some of
them he did:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yet was thy liberality discreet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nice in its choice, and of a tempered heat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And though in act unwearied, <i>secret still</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in some solitude the summer rill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Refreshes, where it winds, the faded green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cheers the drooping flowers, <i>unheard</i>, <i>unseen</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When a biographer can accredit the subject of his narrative
with a disposition to hide his bounty, he is usually apt enough
to catch at so catching a quality. Wellington, we are told,
though his name so rarely figured on subscription lists, was very
liberal in his charities, and was not unfrequently victimized
by impostors. During the Irish famine he is said to have
distributed at least £10,000 among the relief committees;
but “he never said a word about it at Exeter Hall.” Free
gifts by stealth are often characteristic of such natures as
Byron’s; of whom, for instance, we read that, soon after Lord
Falkland’s death, the poet reminded the unfortunate widow
that he was to be godfather to her infant [Byron a sponsor!—but
let that pass]; and that after the “christening” he inserted
a five-hundred pound note in a breakfast cup; but in so
cautious a manner that it was not discovered until he had left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
the house. Montesquieu was even hard and harsh in his repudiation
of thanks from those he helped; his kindness was
accordingly (to speak by quibble) less than kind; insomuch
that one critic recognises in him “un de ces dieux bienfaiteurs
de l’humanité, mais qui n’en partagent point la tendresse.”
Grimm is another example of a satirical tongue with an open
hand, only the hand was opened behind his own back: <i>il sut
être bienveillant en secret</i>. Amid James Watt’s donations in aid
of sound and useful learning, testifies one biographer, were not
wanting others prescribed by true religion, for the consolation
of the poor, and relief of the afflicted; but these works were
done in secret, and with injunctions that his name should not
be made known. Goethe seems to have preserved profound
secrecy with respect to some signal exercises of his beneficence.
Cowper tells Unwin, in one of his letters, that a recent endeavour
of that good pastor to relieve the indigent of his flock
would probably have succeeded better “had it been an affair
of more notoriety than merely to furnish a few poor fellows
with a little fuel to preserve their extremities from the frost.”
“Men really pious delight in doing good by stealth;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> but
nothing less than an ostentatious display of bounty will satisfy
mankind in general.” The Olney bard, in after years, had
pleasant dealings with a signal exemplar of the benefactor by
stealth. He was made the almoner of a charitable stranger, to
whom he thus refers in a letter to John Newton: “Like the
subterraneous flue that warms my myrtles, he does good and is
unseen. His injunctions of secrecy are still as rigorous as
ever, and must therefore be observed with the same attention.”
A year later: “I shall probably never see him,” writes Cowper,
in relating a fresh tide of benefactions; but “he will always
have a niche in the museum of my reverential remembrance.”
Even without <i>that</i>, the Unknown had his reward.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TO-MORROW"><i>TO-MORROW.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. James</span> iv. 13, 14.</p>

</div>

<p>The rich man in the parable was self-complacently far-sighted
in his foresight, when he took stock of his much
goods laid up for many years; but that very night his soul was
to be required of him. Take thine ease; eat, drink, and be
merry, was his easy-going style of self-communing: many are
the years in store for thee, and all of these well stored with
whatever makes this life worth the living. And just in the
same easy-going style is pitched the prospective self-assurance
of the worldlings censured by St. James. “Go to now, ye that
say, to-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and continue
there a year, and buy, and sell, and get gain: whereas ye
know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life?
it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then
vanisheth away.” Boast not thyself of to-morrow, for thou
knowest not what a day may bring forth. To-day, while it is
called to-day,—hardly this can be called thine. But to-morrow,
whose is that? Even the uttermost sensualist owns it to be
none of his, when he sets up for his motto, at once a reminder to
live fast and a <i>memento mori</i>,—Let us eat and drink to-day, for
to-morrow we die. So far he is at least verbally wiser than his
brethren of the cup and the platter, whose style is, “Come ye,
I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink;
and to-morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.”
Little reck they of the platitude that all flesh is grass, which
to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven.</p>

<p>Macbeth’s threefold To-morrow is a triplet that by no means
goes trippingly off the tongue:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<span class="smcap">To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow</span>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the last syllable of recorded time;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The way to dusty death.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So muses the usurper, besieged in his last fastness, while the
cry is still, <i>They come</i>—even the enemy and the avenger; a cry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
varied by one of women bewailing their mistress dead. He
has supped full of horrors; and the cry of “The queen, my
lord, is dead,” but elicits for response, “She should have died
hereafter; there would have been a time for such a word.—<i>To-morrow,
and to-morrow, and to-morrow.</i>”...</p>

<p>In some such mood was usurping Gloster, on the eve of
destruction, pitching his tent on Bosworth Field, and meditating,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">... “Here will I lie to-night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">[<i>Soldiers begin to set up the King’s tent.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But where to-morrow?—Well, all’s one for that.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To the meanest private in rank and file the to-morrow that
shall bring on a battle cannot but be a momentous thought.
As his grace of York says, on the eve of Hotspur’s encounter
with the king’s forces at Shrewsbury,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must ’bide the touch.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While there’s life there’s hope, and hope is, by the nature of
it, intent on to-morrow. As with hopes, so with fears. And
hopes and fears together make up the sum of what has interest
in life. No wonder, then, if to-morrow is a frequent word with
the poet-philosopher of human life; and that in comedy and in
tragedy alike, it serves his turn. Be it a wedding for to-morrow
or an execution for to-morrow, Shakspeare iterates and reiterates
the phrase, with all the dramatic realism that informs
and vivifies his creations. Is it the wedding of Hero with
Claudio, for instance? “When are you married, madam?”
asks Ursula of the bride; who, with affected levity, replies,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why, every day; to-morrow. Come, go in;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll show thee some attires; and have thy counsel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Little she recks of what is to betide her ere to-morrow dawn.
Or is it an execution? Hear Angelo’s decree against another
(quite another) Claudio:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It would be thus with him;—he must die to-morrow.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Isab.</i> To-morrow! O, that’s sudden! Spare, him, spare him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">He’s not prepared for death.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many scenes later we have the Provost imparting his fate to
the doomed man:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Look, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis now dead-midnight, and by eight to-morrow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou must be made immortal.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Presently the disguised duke comes in, and asks of the Provost,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he must die to-morrow?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Prov.</i> <span class="hemi10">None, sir; none.”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One may wonder whether Macbeth, brooding on the vague
and vasty gloom of that word, bethought him of the fatal first
use of it in his incipient designs against his sovran. The
gracious Duncan, he tells his wife, on reaching home, is to
become his guest to-night:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Lady M.</i> And when goes hence?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Macb.</i> To-morrow,—as he purposes.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Lady M.</i> <span class="hemi12">O, never</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall sun that morrow see!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Reason good, or rather, in a bad sense, reason of the worst,
had Macbeth to brood in after-days, when the morrow that
never came to Duncan, had come blood-stained to <i>him</i>,—on the
far-reaching capacities of so memorable a phrase. But from
Shakspeare turn to other sources of illustration.</p>

<p>Truth as well as pathos has been justly ascribed to the following
expansion of a very natural sentiment—“the fear of
personal oblivion in one’s own home”—artistically rendered by
one of a gifted family of artists:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I listened to their honest chat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Said one: ‘To-morrow we shall be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plod, plod along the featureless sands</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And coasting miles and miles of sea.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said one: ‘Before the turn of tide</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We will achieve the eyrie-seat.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said one: ‘To-morrow shall be like</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To-day, but much more sweet.’</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘To-morrow,’ said they, strong with hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And dwelt upon the pleasant way;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘To-morrow,’ cried they, one and all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While no one spoke of yesterday.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then life stood still at blessed noon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I, only I, had passed away:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘To-morrow and to-day,’ they cried:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I was of yesterday.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a critical point in Mr. Charles Reade’s story of what
he calls very hard cash, when Noah Skinner, the fraudulent
banker’s clerk, old and dying, proposes to himself, and resolves
to deliver up, to-morrow, the receipt for fourteen thousand
pounds, his criminal possession and crafty retention of which
has caused such profound and wide-spread misery. “A sleepy
languor now came over him; ... but his resolution remained
unshaken; by-and-by waking up from a sort of heavy
dose, he took, as it were a last look at the receipt, and murmured,
‘My head, how heavy it feels.’ But presently he roused
himself, full of his penitent resolution, and murmured again
brokenly, ‘I’ll—take it to—Pembroke-street to—morrow: to—mor—row.”
Fool—like other us fools of nature—that night
his soul was required of him. The to-morrow found him, and
so did the detectives, dead.</p>

<p>Among other visitors and applicants at the mystical Intelligence
Office thrown open to our gaze by Nathaniel Hawthorne,
there totters hastily in a grandfatherly personage, so earnest in
his uniform alacrity that his white hair floats backwards as he
hurries up to the desk, while his dim eyes catch a momentary
lustre from his vehemence of purpose. This venerable figure
explains that he is in search of To-morrow.</p>

<p>“I have spent all my life in pursuit of it,” adds the sage old
gentleman, “being assured that To-morrow has some vast
benefit or other in store for me. But I am now getting a little
in years, and must make haste, for unless I overtake To-morrow
soon, I begin to be afraid it will finally escape me.”</p>

<p>“This fugitive To-morrow, my venerable friend,” said the
Man of Intelligence, “is a stray child of Time, and is flying
from his father into the region of the infinite. Continue your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
pursuit, and you will doubtless come up with him; but as to
the earthly gifts which you expect, he has scattered them all
among a throng of Yesterdays.”</p>

<p>The grandsire is obliged to content himself with this enigmatical
response, and hastens forth with a quick clatter of his
staff upon the floor; and as he disappears, a little boy scampers
through the door in chase of a butterfly, which has got astray
amid the barren sunshine of the city. Had the old gentleman,
suggests our ever-suggestive moralist, been shrewder, he might
have detected To-morrow under the semblance of that gaudy
insect.</p>

<p><i>J’ai vécu</i>—I managed to keep alive—was the Abbé Siéyès’
answer to those who, in after days, asked him how he spent
his time in the Reign of Terror. And it is in allusion to his
position at that season of peril, when no one could reckon on
a morrow—<i>nul ne pouvait se promettre un lendemain</i>—that he
quotes the <i>vers charmants</i> made in 1708 by Maucroix, then
fourscore and upwards:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Chaque jour est un bien que du Ciel je reçoi!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Jouissons aujourd’hui de celui qu’il nous donne:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Il n’appartient pas plus aux jeunes gens qu’à moi,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Et celui de demain n’appartient à personne.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What shall we be doing to-morrow at this time?” said
Ducos, as the Girondins were whiling away their last evening
here on earth. And each of them replied as the humour took
him, or the subject impressed him. The favourite answer
seems to have been, We shall sleep after the fatigues of the
day. To some the feeling may have been, too literally and
very bitterly, what Wordsworth versified as he gazed from
Rydal Mount on a slowly-sinking star:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“We struggle with our fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While health, power, glory, from their height decline,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Depressed; and then extinguished; and our state,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this, how different, lost Star, from thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That no to-morrow shall our beams restore!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow. For some time
had the Emperor Francis—Maria Theresa’s consort—been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
threatened with an apoplexy, when, on the morning of the 18th
of August, 1764, being pressed by his sister to be blooded, he
answered, “I am engaged this evening to sup with Joseph, and
will not disappoint him; but I promise you I will be blooded
to-morrow.” At the opera in the evening he was taken ill.
Retiring, he was struck with apoplexy, and died at Joseph’s
feet, for he had fallen from Joseph’s arms. At his feet—like
one of old time—he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at his feet
he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</p>

<p>Boast not thyself of to-morrow. Hardly less hackneyed in
the ear of scholar and schoolboy, yet hardly less impressive
as truisms with ever-living truth in them, are Horace’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quis scit an adjiciant hodiernæ crastina summæ</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(who knows whether the powers above will add a morrow to
the day that now is?), and Seneca’s Never was man so in
favour with the gods as to be able to promise himself a morrow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Nemo tam divos habuit faventes,</div>

<p>When Archias, the polemarch at Thebes, dissolved in wine
and pleasure, received from his pontifical namesake at Athens
a full and particular account by letter of the conspiracy of
Pelopidas and the exiles, who were even then counting the
minutes ere they struck the blow,—although the messenger
expressly urged his excellency to read the missive forthwith, as
the contents were of instant import, Archias only smiled a tipsy
smile, and said, “Business to-morrow.” Then he put the unopened
letter under the bolster of his couch, and resumed his
colloquy with his host, Philidias, who was in the plot, and who
was taking good care to ply the polemarch with wine. Business
to-morrow. To-morrow as he purposed! Oh, never should
sun that morrow see.</p>

<p><i>Si hodie non es paratus, quo modo cras eris? <span class="smcap">Cras</span> est dies
incertus: et qui scis si crastinum habebis</i>? To-morrow, in this
its prospective, procrastinating sense, is denounced by Mr.
Sala, with all due asperity, as a wretched, cowardly, idiotic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
subterfuge and apology—a “suicidal delusion and pitfall.” Yes,
to-morrow I will begin to learn Syro-Chaldaic (we overhear
him saying): I will read the novel of the day to-day. To-morrow
I will dine on a mutton-chop and a glass of water.
To-day I will ask the <i>chef</i> at the club to send me up a pretty little
dinner, not forgetting that irresistible <i>choufleur au gratin</i>, and bid
the butler bring me that curious pommard with the iron-grey
seal. To-morrow I will finish my <i>magnum opus</i>, my “Treatise
on the Books of Job and Ecclesiastes in their relation to
Human Wisdom and Knowledge.” To-day flippant rubbish or
frothy egotism shall flow from my pen. To-morrow I will pay my
tailor. To-day I will order a new coat. In fine: “To-morrow
I will atone for the wrong, and pray for strength to continue in
the right. To-day I will follow my devices, and listen to the
promptings of the world, the flesh, and the devil. To-morrow,
and to-morrow, and to-morrow.”</p>

<p>For many years, the late Alfred de Vigny continued slowly
amassing poetical materials, though publishing nothing, and
murmuring always, like André Chenier,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rien n’est fait aujourd’hui, tout sera fait <i>demain</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The morrow has come, wrote the <i>Journal des Débats</i>, in recording
his death, and his artist hands are cold in the grave.</p>

<p>Says the Cordelier to the condemned Thief in Mat Prior’s
derry-down ballad,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Courage, friend; to-day is your period of sorrow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And things will go better, believe me, to-morrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But what says the Thief in reply?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To-morrow? our hero replied in a fright:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He that’s hanged before noon, ought to think of to-night.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Prior will supply us with more than one study of the
subject. Here is a variation, for instance, in matter, manner,
and metre:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The hoary fool, who many days</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Has struggled with continued sorrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Renews his hope, and blindly lays</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The desperate bet upon to-morrow.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To-morrow comes; ’tis noon, ’tis night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This day like all the former flies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet on he runs, to seek delight</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To-morrow, till to-night he dies.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The gaming allusion of the first stanza reminds us of the
picture of a certain devotee at the <i>roulette</i> table at Hombourg,
who kept his seat—tranquil, immovable, vigilant,—the Napoleon
of <i>roulette</i>; in whose victorious progress Marengos and
Austerlitzes succeeded each other, as if Moscow and the
Beresina were phantoms—as if to-morrow would never come.
To-morrow; ay, that dread to-morrow that comes to all: the
fateful <i>Demain</i> of Victor:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Demain est la sapin du trône,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aujourd’hui c’en est le velours.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yes, to-morrow is the coarse deal, with its ten sacks, that forms
the framework of the throne, as to-day is its velvet and gilding.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Demain c’est le coursier qui s’abat plein d’écume;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Demain, O conquérant, c’est Moscou qui s’allume</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">La nuit comme un flambeau:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">C’est not’ vieille garde qui jonche au lointain la plaine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Demain c’est Waterloo! Demain c’est Ste. Helène!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Demain c’est le tombeau!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And yet to-morrow was, for good or bad, for better for
worse, a favourite phrase with Napoleon. His last words to
Murat at nightfall, in the hope of battle with the Russians on
the Dwina next day, were, “To-morrow, at five, the sun of
Austerlitz!” After the combat of Reichenbach, which lost
him Duroc, he sat alone, in moody meditation, neither speaking
nor to be spoken with; appealed to in vain for orders
by Caulaincourt and Maret: “To-morrow—everything,” was
the only answer their most urgent demands could wring from
him, in his hour of dejection and theirs of need. In another
mood was the emperor when, after Leipsic, he pressed the
Austrian cabinet to side with him, and at once. If they were
wise, he said, they would do so forthwith. They could do so,
he told their representative, that evening. To-morrow it might
perhaps be too late; for who could foretell the events of
to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>So thought Sunderland, in that “agony of terror,” almost
over-wrought or over-coloured, perhaps, by Macaulay, which
impelled him to resign office, in a sort of frenzied haste. He
had asked some of his friends to come to his house that he
might consult them; they came at the appointed time, but
found that he had gone to Kensington, and had left word that
he should soon be back. When he joined them, they observed
that he had not the gold key which is the badge of the Lord
Chamberlain, and asked where it was. “At Kensington,”
answered Sunderland. They found that he had tendered his
resignation, and that it had been, after a long struggle,
accepted. They blamed his haste, and told him that since he
had summoned them to advise him on that day, he might at
least have waited till the morrow. “To-morrow,” he exclaimed
“would have ruined me. To-night has saved me.”</p>

<p>A signal contrast the despairing minister presents to the
poet’s picture of credulous hope which ever promises a morrow
better than to-day (like the voluptuaries branded by the
Hebrew prophet, who hug themselves in the assurance that
To-morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">... “Credula vitam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spes fovet, ac melius cras fore semper ait.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They say that To-morrow never comes. The great Greek
father with the golden mouth seems to have based an ethical
warning on this thought, when he bids us defer not till to-morrow,
for to-morrow is a vanishing quantity. Μὴ εἰς τὴν
αὔριον ἀναβάλλου· ἡ γὰρ αὔριον οὐδέ ποτε λαμβάνει τέγος. The moral
is one with that of the Latin satirist—though <i>he</i> makes to-morrow
come fast enough, one <i>per diem</i>,—and go quite as fast
as it came:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">... “Cum lux altera venit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jam cras hesternum consumpsimus; ecce aliud cras</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Egerit hys annos.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Matter-of-fact people will tell you that To-morrow does
come, and fix by their stop-watch the instant of its arrival.
Nay, they can appeal to the <i>primus inter poetas</i> for poetical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
verification of their view. Says the Messenger to the Provost,
while it is yet dark, on the morning which is appointed to be
Claudio’s last, “Good morrow; for, as I take it, it is almost
day.” And so with the peers who enter sleepless King
Henry’s chamber, at the hour they name:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Warwick.</i> Many good morrows to your majesty.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>K. Hen.</i> Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>But, in its own sense, the saying holds good, and is good
sense too, that To-morrow never comes. One might take for
emblem of its import the touching story told by Southey, of a
lady on the point of marriage, whose affianced husband usually
travelled by the stage-coach to visit her, and who, going one
day to meet him, found instead of her betrothed an old friend,
despatched to announce to her his sudden death. She uttered
a scream, and piteously exclaimed, “He is dead!” But then
all consciousness of the affliction that had befallen her ceased.
From that fatal moment she had daily, for fifty years, at the
time Dr. Uwins wrote, and “in all seasons, traversed the distance
of a few miles, where she expected her future husband
to alight from the coach; and every day [adds the doctor,
writing in the then present tense] she utters in a plaintive tone,
“He is not come yet! I will return to-morrow.” <i>To-morrow,
and to-morrow, and to-morrow</i>—that to her never was, but
always was to be.</p>

<p>Why, and how, To-morrow never comes, might be discussed
in a strain of transcendental metaphysics. Mr. Carlyle, in a
memorable chapter headed Natural Supernaturalism, expounds
in his mystic suggestive way the philosophic thesis, that Time
and Space are but creations of God,—with whom as it is a
universal <span class="smcap">Here</span>, so it is an everlasting Now. And as regards
Man: is the Past annihilated, or only past? is the Future non-extant,
or only future? “The curtains of Yesterday drop
down, and the curtains of To-morrow roll up; but Yesterday
and To-morrow both <i>are</i>. Pierce through the Time-element,
glance into the Eternal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>It is but a glance the strongest eye can take, in that direction.
But even a glance may secure a glimpse of things
which filmy, unpurged, downlooking eye hath not seen, nor
ear heard—for they seem to involve unspeakable words, which
it is not lawful for a man to utter. To-morrow thou hast never
seen; to thee it has never come. But it shall come. And it
that shall come, will come; and will not tarry. Wait the great
teacher, Death. <i><span class="smcap">Cras</span> iterabimus æquor</i>: to-morrow we shall
be sounding our dim and perilous way across the dark waters
of that fathomless sea. If the prospect appals, happy he that
can adapt to his own hopes, in serenest confidence, yet eager
anticipation,—as he speculates on what a day, and the Better
Land, may bring forth: To-morrow, to fresh woods and
pastures new.</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">1 Corinthians</span> xiv. 33, 40.</p>

</div>

<p>Practically, the amount of confusion prevalent in the
church of Corinth, arising from irregularities incident to
the exercise of “tongues,” and to the undisciplined energies of
a mixed congregation, appears to have almost rivalled the disorder
in the theatre of Ephesus, when the whole city was filled
with confusion, and some cried one thing, and some another;
for the assembly was confused, and the most part knew not
wherefore they were come together. So, when the whole church
of Corinth were come together into one place, and all spoke
with tongues, to outsiders that for the nonce stepped inside
they must appear mad. All things were done indecorously and
in most admired disorder. Now, St. Paul was for having all
things done decently and in order. “For God is not the author
of confusion, but of peace.” Order is Heaven’s first law. The
same apostle is prompt to remind the Thessalonians that he
behaved himself not disorderly among them; and this he did
because he heard that there were some among them which
walked disorderly—ἀτάκτως. The apostolic canon for both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
Corinth and Thessalonica, and all other churches, is, Πὰντα δὲ
κατὰ τάξιν γινέσθω. Let them all walk by this same rule, and all
mind this same thing.</p>

<p class="tb">As with the sect of Pythagoreans, virtue was defined to be a
harmony, unity, and an endeavour to resemble the Deity,—so
the whole life of man, they taught, should be an attempt to
represent on earth the beauty and harmony displayed in the
order of the universe. It was the doctrine of Pythagoras himself,
that by action as well as by thought the individual as well
as the state should represent in themselves “an image of the
order and harmony by which the world was sustained and
regulated.” But as Prior puts it, when he considers the heavens,
the starry worlds of God’s ordaining, or ordering,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How mean the order and perfection sought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the best product of the human thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Compared to the great harmony that reigns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In what the Spirit of the world ordains!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Lord Lytton suggestively pictures to us one of his characters
alone in the streets by night, striding noiselessly on, under the
gaslights, under the stars; gaslights primly marshalled at equidistance;
stars that seem to the naked eye dotted over space
without symmetry or method—“Man’s order, near and finite,
is so distinct; the Maker’s order, remote, infinite, is so beyond
man’s comprehension of what <i>is</i> order.” Chauncy Hare
Townshend expresses the same idea in an address to the
stars:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Distance deceives the sight. Ye move and sway</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With life; yet are your hoverings on the brink</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of ruin but the freedom and the play</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That binds your dance of beauty, link to link,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In woven joy that shall not fail nor shrink.</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">... Thrones arise and sink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth is transformed beneath you: ye remain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clasping distracted man with Order’s sacred chain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So Wordsworth, addressing as it were a deified idea of Duty,
pays this homage:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">... “Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the most ancient heavens through Thee are fresh and strong.”</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>Well may Hooker speculate on what would become of man,
were Nature to intermit her course, and leave altogether, though
but for a while, the observation of her own laws; if the frame
of that heavenly arch erected over our heads should loosen and
dissolve itself; if celestial spheres should forget their wonted
motions, and by irregular volubility turn themselves any way as
it might happen; if the prince of the lights of heaven, which
now as a giant doth run his unwearied course, should, as it were
through a languishing faintness, begin to stand and rest himself;
if the moon should wander from her beaten way, the times
and seasons of the year blend themselves by disordered and
confused mixture—“See we not plainly that obedience of
creatures unto the law of Nature is the stay of the whole
world?” Again to quote from “The Mystery of Evil,” the
same star-gazer speaking:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do I not climb in you, O blessèd host,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The way of symbols, shining steps to God?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When most man knows you, he is certain most</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">One law unswerving reigns from star to clod.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Of law,” says Hooker, at the close of his first book of Ecclesiastical
Polity, with an eloquence which has ever been most
admired by the most admirable masters of English prose,—“Of
law there can be no less acknowledged, than that her seat is the
bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world; all things
in heaven and earth do her homage, the very least as feeling
her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power:
both angels and men, and creatures of what condition soever,
though each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform
consent, admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy.”
Considering when he wrote, what he wrote, and to what purpose
and in what spirit he wrote, there seems to us a beautiful
consistency in Richard Hooker’s deathbed meditations, as
related in the familiar memoir by Izaak Walton. Found by his
trustiest visitor, “deep in contemplation, and not inclinable to
discourse,” and asked what was the subject of his present
thoughts, he replied, “That he was meditating the number and
nature of angels, and their blessed obedience and order, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
which, peace could not be in heaven; and oh, that it
might be so on earth!”</p>

<p>There is not, affirms a modern divine, a corner of the world,
nor a process of nature, nor a piece of God’s handiwork of any
kind whatever, on which His love of order is not written with a
plainness not to be mistaken. “System and method, law and
order, symmetry and punctuality, are conspicuous everywhere;
indicating at once the value attached to these things in the
mind of God, and his dislike for their opposites—confusion,
fitfulness, irregularity.” Nor is the Divine love of order a
quality that ever leads to stiffness, formality, or monotony; for
it is shown to be constantly associated with beauty, variety,
and freedom.</p>

<p>M. Jules Simon interpolates into his argument for the vast
preponderance of good over evil in the world, a casually expressed
identification of good with order: “le bien, c’est-à-dire,
l’ordre, car dans le monde le bien et l’ordre ne font qu’un.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some think Disorder means God’s moral plan;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Readers familiar with the writings first and last of Mr.
Carlyle, will readily call to mind many a terse utterance in vindication
of the Divine authorship and Divine authority of order.
<i>Dis</i>order he pronounces to be a thing which “veracious created
Nature, even because it is not Chaos and a waste-whirling baseless
Phantasm,” rejects and disowns. “<i>Dis</i>order, insane by the
nature of it, is the hatefullest of things to man, who lives by
sanity and by order.” “All Anarchy, all evil, all injustice, is,
by the nature of it, ... suicidal, and cannot endure.”
“Arrangement is indispensable to man; Arrangement, were it
grounded only on that old primary evangel of Force, with Sceptre
in the shape of Hammer!” Such sentences admit of almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
infinite multiplication. “Anarchy, hateful as Death, is abhorrent
to the whole nature of man; and so must itself soon
die.” Hence this philosopher’s partiality for “heroes,” even
of the least estimable type, provided they have will and force to
replace confusion by order. Cortès is not among the specified
Heroes of his special Hero-worship; but he deserves a place
by reason of the preamble to that code of ordinances, as the
conqueror of Mexico himself terms them, which he set forth in
restraint of his army: the essential purport of this preamble
being, that in all institutions, whether Divine or human (if the
latter have any worth), order is the great law.</p>

<p>It was in support of the cause of social order that Luther
took to exposing the dangers due to ignorant innovators, and
strenuously declared that “God Himself constituted certain
authorities to direct the world; for it is a great feature in His
magnificent system, that there shall be order here below.”
Doctor Martin may, in this respect, be called a man after our
Hero-worshipper’s own heart; such another as the one of whom
he wrote,—“Wheresoever Disorder may stand or lie, let it have
a care; here is the man that has declared war with it, that will
never make peace with it. Man is the Missionary of Order; he
is the servant, not of the Devil and of Chaos, but of God and the
universe.” And Christian doctrine teaches that the order and
beauty of the outward world are symbols of that inward order
and symmetry, that peace and purity of heart, that universal
harmony between God’s will and man’s will, which it is one
great object of Christianity to establish.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then quick I ran my glance about the globe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To find Religion link’d with Order’s aim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ruling by love and light,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">says the Christian poet, who has, however, to deplore the disappointments
of his quest. Of all orderly things that are
beautiful in God’s eyes, it has been said, there can be none so
beautiful as an orderly or holy soul. “Once in this world the
sight presented itself in spotless beauty and brilliancy.” Everything
there seen was in its place: reason, conscience, will, feeling,
instinct, appetite, “all most beautifully arranged; each was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
in perfect health, and all were in thorough harmony with the
will of God.” But that was God manifest in the flesh. Order
incarnate. Without Him, in the material world, was not anything
made that was made. Apart from Him, the moral world
is without form and void, and darkness covers the face of its
deep. Order, in fine, is the indispensable postulate of every
given cosmos. In the words of Schiller—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It is the keystone of the world’s wide arch;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The one sustaining and sustained by all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, if it fall, brings all in ruin down.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the Church as a family, George Herbert, ever quaint in his
devotion, sings or says—after a depreciation of his own unruly
thoughts:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, Lord, the house and family are Thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though some of them repine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn out these wranglers, which defile Thy seat:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For where Thou dwellest all is neat.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“First Peace and Silence all disputes control,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then <i>Order</i> plays the soul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And giving all things their set forms and hours,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes of wild woods sweet walks and bowers.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So Dryden traces to harmony this universal frame—a cosmos
evolved from chaos, from a heap of jarring atoms that, at the
Divine summons,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>In order</i> to their stations leap.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Shaftesbury contends that the admiration and love of order, in
whatever kind, is “naturally improving to the temper, advantageous
to social affection, and highly assistant to virtue—which
is itself no other than the love of order and beauty in society.”
In the meanest subjects of the world, he goes on to say, the
appearance of order gains upon the mind, and draws the affections
towards it. “For ’tis impossible that such a Divine order
should be contemplated without ecstasy and rapture; since in
the common subjects of science, and the liberal arts, whatever
is according to just harmony and proportion is so transporting
to those who have any knowledge or practice in the kind.” In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
another place he elaborates the thesis, that whatever things
have order, have unity of design, and concur in one, and are
parts constituent of one whole—just as a symphony is a certain
system of proportioned sounds. It is noteworthy that Pythagoras
deduced his celebrated theory of the music of the spheres
from his assumption that everything in the great arrangement
(κόσμος) which he called the world must be harmoniously
arranged (and that, accordingly, the planets were at the same
relative distance as the divisions of the monochord, etc.)
Divine as the philosophy of Plato is commonly esteemed, there
are, on the other hand, occasional glimpses in it of what one of
his commentators calls the “appalling doctrine” that God
alternately governs and forsakes the world—the world when he
forsakes it, suddenly changing its orbit, so that all things are in
disorder, and mundane existence is totally disarranged: “only
after some time do things settle down to a sort of order, though
of a very imperfect kind.” Spinoza takes order to be a thing of
the imagination, as also he does right and wrong, useful and
hurtful—these being merely such, he argues, in relation to us.
But this would not prevent him, from his stand-point, assenting
to the ethical import of order—as expounded for instance by
the Shakspearian Ulysses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Observe degree, priority, and place, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Office, and custom, in all line of order....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take but degree away, untune that string,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hark, what discord follows! each thing meets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In mere oppugnancy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Order, writes Southey, is the sanity of the mind, the health
of the body, the peace of the city, the security of the State.
Diogenes held with the Dorian lawgivers, that order (κόσμος)
is the basis of civil government. As the beams to a house, it
has been said, as the bones to the microcosm of man, so is
order to all things. Balzac is treating of <i>harmonie politique</i>
when he says that harmony is the poetry of order, and that
“the peoples” have a keen need of order. The racy author of
the “Biglow Papers” discourses in his shrewd, homely style, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
the indispensableness (not that he uses such a word) of orderly
established law:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Onsettle <i>that</i>, an’ all the world goes whiz,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A screw is loose in everything there is.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Carlyle, in his apology for Knox in the act of pulling
down cathedrals—as if he were a seditious rioting demagogue—urges
that he was precisely the reverse of that. Knox, he
maintains, wanted no pulling down of stone edifices, but wanted
leprosy and darkness to be thrown out of the lives of men.
“Tumult was not his element; it was the tragic feature of his
life that he was forced to dwell so much on that.” Every such
man, on Mr. Carlyle’s showing, is the born enemy of disorder—hates
to be in it; but what then? “Smooth falsehood is not
order; it is the general sum total of disorder. Order is truth—each
thing standing on the basis that belongs to it. Order and
falsehood cannot subsist together.” And it is in treating of
another of his heroes elect, that the same philosopher contends
on behalf of such others of them as seem to have worked as
revolutionary men, that nevertheless every great man, every
genuine man, is by the nature of him a son of order, not of disorder—a
seeming anarchist, yet to his whole soul anarchy is
hostile, hateful. “His mission is Order; every man’s is. He
is here to make what was disorderly, chaotic, into a thing ruled,
regular. He is the missionary of Order.” Is not all work of
man in this world, we are emphatically asked, a making of
Order?</p>

<p>The Abbé Duval, writing to Mme. Récamier, as her spiritual
counsellor, bids her engrave this elementary truth on her heart
of hearts: “Gravez au-dedans de vous-même cette première
vérité que la religion veut <i>l’ordre</i> avant tout.” Whatsoever doth
make manifest is light, and it is light that reveals a cosmos
where before, in the words of Thomson, a formless grey confusion
covered all:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As when of old (so sung the Hebrew bard)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Light, uncollected, through the chaos urged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its infant way; nor Order yet had drawn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His lovely train from out the dubious gloom.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>That a scrupulous regard for order, in some sort, is nevertheless
compatible with a very low standard of moral worth, is
recognised and illustrated by poet Crabbe—prose-poet the good
parson was, not quite in the accepted sense—in a series of
pithy, if not pungent rhymes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The love of order—I the thing receive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From reverend men, and I in part believe—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shows a clear mind and clean, and whoso needs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This love, but seldom in the world succeeds;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet with this some other love must be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere I can fully to the fact agree;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Valour and study may by order gain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By order sovereigns hold more steady reign;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all the tribes of nature order runs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rules around in systems and in suns:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still has the love of order found a place</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all that’s low, degrading, mean, and base,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all that merits scorn, and all that meets disgrace:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the cold miser, of all change afraid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In pompous men in public seats obeyed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In humble placemen, heralds, solemn drones;</div>
    <div class="center">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Order to these is armour and defence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And love of method serves in lack of sense.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Exceptions allowed for, as in every rule, yet is the rule sufficiently
approved, that order is heaven’s first law. The poet of
“The Angel in the House” in style, and spirit, and sentiment,
how salient a contrast to Crabbe, utters the conceit (<i>poeticè</i>)
in one of his tender preludes, that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sweet Order has its draught of bliss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Graced with the pearl of God’s consent,”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">a conceit that allows of wide application, as do many of those
of so suggestive a writer.</p>

<p>But to conclude. When the judicious Hooker—to call him
by his conventional epithet—lay a-dying, he expressed his joy
at the near prospect of entering a World of Order. The author
of “The Book of the Church” emphasises the import of holy
Richard’s “placid and profound contentment,” by reminding
us that because he had been employed in ecclesiastical polemics,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
and because his life had been passed under the perpetual discomfort
of domestic discord, the happiness of heaven must have
seemed in Hooker’s estimation, to consist primarily in Order, as,
indeed, in all human societies this is the first thing needful.</p>

<p>To him that keepeth sound wisdom and instruction is the
promise given, not only that he shall walk in his way
safely, and his foot shall not stumble,—this for daytime and its
activities,—but further, as regards night-time and its contingencies,

shall lie down, and his sleep shall be sweet. So He giveth His
beloved sleep, of whom the Psalmist said, “I laid me down

order that one may pray with full purpose of heart the prayer,
Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be

“To bed, to bed, to bed.” But what avails <i>that</i> to the somnambulist,
ever in semblance washing her hands, and complaining
of the smell of blood upon them still, and that all the
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten them? Now and then
one meets with a sceptic as to lost sleep being the inevitable
sequent upon crime; and no doubt there are exceptions. Mr.
G. Wingrove Cooke, in his letters from Chinese waters, thus
describes the captive Mandarin, Yeh, whose fellow-passenger to
Calcutta he was: “He goes to bed at eight o’clock, and while
we are reading or writing or playing chess, he sleeps the sleep
of infancy—an unbroken slumber, apparently undisturbed by
visions of widowed women and wailing orphans. This man-killer,
after slaying his hundred thousand human beings, enjoys
sweeter sleep than an innocent London alderman after a turtle
dinner.” Perhaps that is not saying much,—considering what
a turtle dinner comprehends and superinduces. But the next
sentence says a good deal; it is to be hoped, a great deal too
much: “So false are traditions; so false are the remorseful
scenes of Greek and English tragedies.” One would be sorry,
for the dignity of human nature, to believe that all is fiction

There is Mr. Trollope’s Lady Mason, so wistfully, so vainly
longing for rest—to be able to lay aside the terrible fatigue of
being ever on the watch. From the burden of that necessity
she has never been free since her crime was first committed.
“She had never known true rest. She had not once trusted
herself to sleep without the feeling that her first waking thought

he lay in a deep, sweet sleep—so calm and tranquil, though within
the walls of a prison, suffering from injuries, and exposed to
constant danger; gazing with a sense of envy and regret,

heart. He would not have disturbed such slumbers for the
world; and, withdrawing again with a noiseless step, he retired
to his own chamber, and cast himself down upon his bed,
to snatch, at least, that heated and disturbed sleep, which was
all the repose that he was ever more to know on earth.” To

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ONCE_DENIED_THRICE_DENIED"><i>ONCE DENIED, THRICE DENIED.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Matthew</span> xxvi, 69, <i>sq.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Lie engenders lie. Once committed, the liar has to go on
in his course of lying. It is the penalty of his transgression,
or one of the penalties. To the habitual liar, bronzed
and hardened in the custom, till custom becomes second
nature, the penalty may seem no very terrible price to pay.
To him, on the other hand, who, without deliberate intent, and
against his innermost will, is overtaken with such a fault, the
generative power of a first lie to beget others, the necessity of
supporting the first by a second and a third, is a retribution
keenly to be felt, while penitently owned to be most just.</p>

<p>Though it was afar off that Peter followed his Master to the
high-priest’s house, yet he did follow; and, we may be sure,
with little thought, and still less intention, of denying Him
even once. But as he sat by the fire and warmed himself, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
identification of him by a certain maid as certainly a disciple
of Christ was boldly met by the affirmation, or negation,
“Woman, I know Him not.” The lie was uttered; the
winged word of falsehood was on its way. And there an end,
he perhaps hoped. But after a little while, another bystander
recognised him, and asserted the damaging recognition, “Thou
art also of them.” Another denial was the consequence:
“Man, I am not.” An hour passed away, and Peter, in sullen
misery and bewilderment, self-consciously an abject coward
and confirmed liar, had to deny for the third time Him he had
denied once and again. “Of a truth,” affirmed another of the
mixed company, “this fellow also was with Him; for he is a
Galilean.” And Peter said, “Man, I know not what thou
sayest.” And then the cock crew. And then the Lord turned
and looked upon Peter. And at that look—so upbraidingly
expressive, so pathetically recalling recent protestations of
unfaltering allegiance, and the concurrent prediction of lapse
and abandonment—what could Peter do, but with shame and
confusion of face, and with a heart full to bursting, go out, and
weep bitterly.</p>

<p>When he thought thereon, he wept: thought of the Master’s
look, that recalled to him the vehement assurance of loyalty
met by the foretelling of his fall. Thought, too, of the graduation
of his denials; a first involving a second, and the second
exacting yet a third. The third was the cost of the first. He
had not counted the cost then. He had to pay it now.</p>

<p>It was part of the prophet’s burden of woes against the
doomed city, that she had “wearied herself with lies.” Easily
uttered, they may multiply at a rate to trouble the teller of
them, and weary him, if only with the necessity of inventing
new ones to back the old. He must ever be devising fresh
vouchers for his impaired and imperilled credit. He must
continually be endorsing his forged notes, and forging fresh
ones that will stand inspection. <i>Fallacia alia aliam trudit.</i>
And this is weary work.</p>

<p>So we read in Molière. And Corneille has a play (not
original) entirely devoted to the illustration of this subject,
showing <i>qu’il faut bonne mémoire acrès qu’on a menti</i>; the
Menteur κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, being one who <i>entasse fourbe sur fourbe</i>,
and is constrained by the law of his nature, at least of habit,
which is second nature, to be ever adding to the heap of lies
to which he has committed himself. A Spanish proverb—and
<i>Le Menteur</i> is from the Spanish—declares that “for an honest
man half his wits is enough, while the whole are too little for a
knave;” the ways, that is, as Archbishop Trench expounds the
adage, of truth and uprightness are so simple and plain, that a
little wit is abundantly sufficient for those who walk in them;
whereas the ways of falsehood and fraud are so perplexed and
tangled, that sooner or later all the wit of the cleverest rogue
will not preserve him from being entangled therein—a truth
often and wonderfully confirmed in the lives of evil men.</p>

<p>Among the aphorisms of Dean Swift we read: “He who
tells a lie is not sensible how great a task he undertakes; for
he must be forced to invent twenty more to maintain that one.”</p>

<p>It has been called the severe, but appropriate, punishment
of historians who desert the paths of truth for those of paradox,
to be compelled to defend the falsehood to which they have
committed themselves against the ever-accumulating evidences
of the truth. Mr. Robertson, of Brighton, feelingly sketches
the case of one who, being unprepared and accosted suddenly,
says hastily that which is irreconcileable with strict truth; then
to substantiate and make it look probable, misrepresents or
invents something else; and so has woven round himself a
mesh which will entangle his conscience through many a weary
day and many a sleepless night.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> One burden laid on fault,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
he goes on to show, is that chain of entanglement which seems
to drag down to fresh sins. “One step necessitates many
others. One fault leads to another, and crime to crime. The
soul gravitates downward beneath its burden. It was profound
knowledge which prophetically refused to limit Peter’s sin to
once. ‘Verily I say unto thee ... thou shalt deny me
thrice.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Froude shows us Queen Elizabeth stooping to “a
deliberate lie.” At times, he says, writing of her embarrassed
policy in 1565, she “seemed to struggle with her ignominy,
but it was only to flounder deeper into distraction and dishonour.”
In October of that year she publicly denied that she
had encouraged the rebellion in Scotland. In November, we
read, “Never had Elizabeth been in greater danger; and the
worst features of the peril were the creations of her own
untruths.” Again, in May, 1566: “Meanwhile Elizabeth was
reaping a harvest of inconveniences for her exaggerated
demonstrations of friendliness” to the Queen of Scots. Mary
taking her at her word, “Vainly Elizabeth struggled to extricate
herself from her dilemma; resentment was still pursuing
her for her treachery in the past autumn.... She could
but shuffle and equivocate in a manner which had become too
characteristic.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> She was but paying the price of lies—the
being constrained to go on lying still. It is certain, affirms a
popular essayist, that nobody yet ever did anything wrong in
this world without having to tell one or more falsehoods to
begin with: the embryo murderer has to tell a lie about the
pistol or dagger, the would-be suicide about the poison he
purchases; and in fine, “the ways down which the bad ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
Wickedness slides to a shoreless ocean must be greased with
lies.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>English reviewers not long since were prompt to recognise
in Balzac’s “La Marâtre,” as revived to Parisian popularity,
what they rightly accounted wonderful, a moral immaculate
and beyond reproach. And what is that moral? “The
necessity of a life of lying as a punishment for the one great lie
of a mercenary marriage.” One great lie is put out to interest,
and the interest is compound. One great lie involves a ramification
of others, great or small, if there be comparatives of
magnitude in such matters; and memory, if not conscience, is
for ever on the stretch. The sad expedient of renewed issues
is a necessity. As with the involved victim in one of Crabbe’s
Tales:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

Holy Writ, may be referred some remaining illustrations of the

<p>Jacob in Esau’s goodly raiment, and his smooth skin overlaid
with goatskins, was duly prepared for a consistent
course of deception. But the lie upon lie he had to tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
before his end was gained, must have sorely tried what of conscience
he then had. The primary falsehood,—distinctly enounced
in answer to his blind sire’s “Who art thou?” “I am Esau, thy
firstborn,” come back from the chase with the venison Isaac
had desired of his firstborn,—this initial lie had immediately to
be backed by another. How had he found it so quickly?
There is something revolting in the style of the unfaltering
fabrication at once ready to hand, “Because the Lord thy God
brought it to me.” Then ensued that solution of the old man’s
misgivings by a manual examination of the disguised pretender;
it was Esau’s hirsute skin, sure enough, though the voice was
Jacob’s. But the blessing was given. And even after that eventful
benediction, the patriarch, with a yet lingering apprehension,
renewed the pointed question, in its directest form, “Art thou
my very son Esau?” And Jacob said, “I am.” Lie linked to
lie, in a concatenation accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Solent mendaces luere pœnas malefici</i>, says Phædrus: liars
usually pay the penalty of their guilt. And Mrs. Browning
vigorously states one distinctive penalty, where she speaks of
those who—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">... “Pay the price</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of lies, by being constrained to lie on still.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The author of “Romola” powerfully illustrates in that remarkable
book the embarrassments involved in one cowardly
departure from truth. In the chapter headed “Tito’s Dilemma,”
the occasion arises for Tito to fabricate an ingenious lie; an
occasion “which circumstance never fails to beget on tacit
falsity.” Many chapters farther on we find him experiencing
the inexorable law of human souls, that we prepare ourselves
for sudden deeds by the reiterated choice of good or evil that
gradually determines character; and it becomes a question
whether all the resources of lying will save him from being
crushed by the consequences of his habitual choice. At another
juncture we read: “Tito felt more and more confidence as he
went on; the lie was not so difficult when it was once begun;
and as the words fell easily from his lips, they gave him a sense
of power such as men feel when they have begun a muscular feat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
successfully.” The penalty is enforced a few pages later.
“But he had borrowed from the terrible usurer Falsehood, and
the loan had mounted and mounted with the years, till he
belonged to the usurer, body and soul.” Again: “To-night he
had paid a heavier price than ever to make himself safe.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>In the American story of “The Gayworthys,” the like moral
attaches to the course of one unhappy woman who lets herself
slide, half involuntarily, into deeper wrong: she holds her peace;
she makes herself passive. “Her very soul lied to itself in its
false, bewildered reasonings; that is the inherent retribution of
false souls.” There are some acts of folly, remarks the most
popular, probably, of contemporary English penwomen, which
carry falsehood and dissimulation at their heels as certainly as
the shadows which follow us when we walk towards the evening
sun; and we very rarely swerve from the severe boundary-line
of right without being dragged ever so much farther than we
calculated upon across the border.</p>

<p>Corneille’s celebrated play, “Le Menteur,”—but for reading
which Molière asserts his belief that he would never have written
a comedy himself,—is “conveyed” from a Spanish original, and
has itself been Englished by Fielding; the ingenuity of the
piece consisting in the manner in which one lie is made to call
for another, until their wholesale employer is inextricably caught
in the toils.</p>

<p class="noindent">laments the elder Piccolomini, in Schiller’s trilogy. The
commission of one wrong, says Owen Feltham, puts a man
upon a thousand wrongs, perhaps, to maintain that one: injury,
with injury is defended; and we commit a greater, to maintain
a less. “A lie begets a lie, till generations succeed.” Mr.
Carlyle sternly moralises on the growth of accumulated falsities,—“sad
opulence descending by inheritance, always at compound
interest, and always largely increased by fresh acquirement on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
such immensity of standing capital.” One lie, says Owen,
must be thatched with another, or it will soon rain through.</p>

<p>Benvenuto Cellini records in his autobiography, the bitter
experiences he endured in being tempted to lie to the duke,
his patron, lest he should forfeit the favour of the duchess—he
who “was always a lover of truth and an enemy to falsehood,
being then under a necessity of telling lies.” “As I had begun
to tell lies, I plunged deeper and deeper into the mire,”—till a
very Slough of Despond it became to him.</p>

<p>Fool that he was, exclaims Mr. Trollope, of one of his
characters in “Framley Parsonage:” “A man can always do
right, even though he has done wrong before. But the previous
wrong adds so much difficulty to the path—a difficulty which
increases in tremendous ratio, till a man at last is choked in his
struggling, and is drowned beneath the waters.” Mr. Thackeray
sermonises to the same effect: “And so, my dear sir, seeing
that after committing any infraction of the moral laws, you
must tell lies in order to back yourself out of your scrape, let me
ask you whether you had not better forego the crime, so as to
avoid the unavoidable, and unpleasant, and daily-recurring
necessity of the subsequent perjury?” And the cleverest
character this master of social satire ever drew, confesses how
it jarred on her to begin telling lies to a confiding, simple
friend: “But that is the misfortune of beginning with this kind
of forgery. When one fib becomes due as it were, you must
forge another to take up the old acceptance; and so the stock
of your lies in circulation inevitably multiplies, and the danger
of detection increases every day.”</p>

<p>Jeremy Taylor quaintly says of the devil in the ancient
oracles, “When he was put to it at his oracles, and durst not
tell a downright lie, and yet knew not what was truth, many
times he was put to the most pitiful shifts, and trifling equivocations,
and acts of knavery, which, when they were discovered,
... it made him much more contemptible and ridiculous
than if he had said nothing or confessed his ignorance.”</p>

<p>A lie has been called a two-edged sword without a hilt,
which is sure to slip and cut the hand that holds it. “After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
telling one lie, we are sure to tell another; and usually, after
spinning a silly, very complicated, and disgusting web, which
entangles and chokes us, we find out that if we had told the
truth, it would have been much the easier and better plan.”
Lying is likened, again, to borrowing of money-lenders; for the
credit which we get by it we have always to pay heavily for;
and at last we find that the interest by far exceeds the principal,
and we get so inextricably involved that we never fully recover.
“He who tells a lie,” says Pope, “is not sensible how great a
task he undertakes; for he must be forced to invent twenty
more to maintain that one.” Johnson observes that nobody
can live long without knowing that falsehoods of convenience or
vanity are very lightly uttered, and when once uttered are
sullenly supported. He reminds us that Boileau, who desired
to be thought a rigorous and steady moralist, having told a
petty lie to Lewis the Fourteenth, continued it afterwards by
false dates, thinking himself obliged in honour to maintain
what, when he said it, was so well received. Pope himself is
taxed with similar mendacity by Mr. de Quincey, who charges
him, on a certain literary question, with knowingly “preparing
for himself a dire necessity of falsehood.... Once
launched upon such a course, he became pledged and committed
to all the difficulties which it might impose. Desperate
necessities would arise, from which nothing but desperate lying
and hard swearing could extricate him.” And at a subsequent
stage in the <i>facilis descensus</i> he is described, rather imaginatively,
as feeling, and groaning as he felt, that fresh falsehoods were
in peremptory demand. “This comes of telling lies,” is supposed
to be his bitter reflection: “one lie makes a necessity
for another.”</p>

<p>The Leucippus of Beaumont and Fletcher thus admonishes
an intimate:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_TIME_TO_WEEP_AND_A_TIME_TO_LAUGH"><i>A TIME TO WEEP, AND A TIME TO LAUGH.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Ecclesiastes</span> iii. 4.</p>

</div>

<p>As to everything there is a season, and a time to every
purpose under the sun,—for as Shakspeare words it,
“How many things by season seasoned are to their right praise
and true perfection!”—be sure that the Wise King includes
laughter and weeping in the list. “A time to weep, and a
time to laugh.” Acquainted with grief, he had also been
familiar with merriment. He had said in his heart, Go to, now,
I will prove thee with mirth; but the result was that he said
of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?—For all
this, he freely recognises a time to laugh, so that one keep to
the time. So much depends, here, on the due observance of
times and seasons. It is with the frivolous habit of laughing
out of season, and at all seasons, that the following notes are
concerned.</p>

<p>The laureate’s is a good keynote to begin with:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Prythee weep, May Lilian!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gaiety without eclipse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wearieth me, May Lilian.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So with Barry Cornwall and his Hermione:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Something thou dost want, O queen!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(As the gold doth ask alloy,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tears,—amidst thy laughter seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Pity,—mingling with the joy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such a conjunction as the courtier records of Cordelia in “King
Lear”—sunshine and rain at once: “her smiles and tears were
like a better day: those happy smiles that played on her ripe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
lip, seemed not to know what guests were in her eyes:” “in
brief, sorrow would be a rarity most beloved, if all could so become
it.” Nothing, we often hear it said, is so tedious as uniformity;
and under the bright sky of Italy one sometimes sighs
for a cloud. “A gay writer, who,” says Horace Walpole,
“should only express satisfaction without variety, would soon
be nauseous.” Johnson’s Papilius winds up his confession, in
the “Rambler,” with a whine on the melancholy necessity of supporting
that character by study, which he gained by levity;
having learned too late that gaiety must be recommended by
higher qualities, and that mirth can never please long but as
the efflorescence of a mind loved for its luxuriance, but esteemed
for its usefulness. There must be fruitage as well as
blossomy “efflorescence;” as Cowper is fain to enforce, when
in the closing lines of the “Task,” he records how he once,
when called to dress a sofa with the flowers of verse, played
awhile with that light task, obedient to the fair:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">... “but soon, to please her more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom flowers alone I knew would little please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let fall the unfinished wreath, and roved for fruit.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Mark Mrs. Browning’s picture of the Lady Geraldine:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In her utmost lightness there is truth—and often she speaks lightly—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Has a grace in being gay, which even mournful souls approve,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the root of some grave earnest thought is understruck so rightly</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As to justify the foliage and the waving flowers above.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So with Lord Lytton’s Helen Mainwaring, the sunny gladness of
whose nature must have vent like a bird’s, though he forbids us
to fancy that that gladness speaks the levity which comes from
the absence of thought: “it is rather from the depth of thought
that it springs, as from the depth of a sea comes its music.”
Well and wisely Molière’s Cléonte exclaims, “Veux-tu de
ces enjouements épanouis, de ces joies toujours ouvertes? et
vois tu rien de plus impertinent que des femmes qui rient à
tout propos?” Such a <i>femme</i> as the same author’s Zerbinette,
a self-convicted giggler in and out of season, yet whose confession
may be twisted into an example the other way, when she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
says, “J’ai l’humeur enjouée, et sans cesse je ris: mais, tout
en riant, je suis sérieuse sur de certains chapitres.”</p>

<p>Among the writings of M. de St. Evremond there is an essay
on the Idea of a Woman that never was, nor ever will be
found. Emilia he calls this all too perfect, impossible she. And
amongst the foremost of Emilia’s fine qualities he reckons the
co-existence of seriousness <i>au fond</i> with vivacity of mien. “For
we find that the gayest humour doth, at length, become tiresome;
... the most effervescent liveliness either disgusts
or wearies you.” In the case of the celebrated Duchesse de
Longueville, De Retz notices the exquisite effect of the sudden
bursts of gaiety which would at times dispel her habitual but
not inexpressive languor. Mdlle. de Scudéry, in her “Clélie,”
was painting a well-known, perhaps too well-known, contemporary
in the person of Clarice, when, “parmi toute cette disposition
qu’elle a pour la joie,” she ascribes to this charmer,
<i>qui rit si aisément</i>, a facile faculty of tear-shedding: <i>elle sait
pleurer</i>, whenever occasion justifies weeping. As Lady Eastlake
says, in her little treatise on Music, a change of key is the most
powerful engine in the hands of a musician: we cannot bear
the monotony of one key long, even the most joyful: “Gaiety
without eclipse wearieth me, May Lilian.” We long for “a
mournful muse, soft pity to infuse.” The Hon. Miss Byron
takes the liberty of telling the sister of Sir Charles Grandison
that “Your brother has hinted, Charlotte, that he loves you for
your vivacity, and should still more, if you consulted time and
occasion.” The affections are justly said to be more readily
called into play by a mixture of mirth and melancholy; ours
being a twofold life, the union of mortal with immortal, we
covet happiness, yet turn back anon to the more majestic form
of sorrow. There is a form of cheerfulness which, we are assured,
nobody can stand:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Send me hence a thousand miles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From a face that always smiles;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">people ostentatiously and pretentiously cheerful being not unfrequently
foolish people: their spirits of a brisk but thin quality—nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
about them in good working order. “For, in truth,
the most fortunate existence has cares enough to make gravity
our normal condition.” Roland Graeme, in the “Abbot,”
earnestly assures his vivacious companion, “Ay, but, fair
Catherine, there are moments of deep and true feeling, which
are worth ten thousand years of liveliest mirth.” Melancholy
Minna is a fine relief by contrast to laughter-loving Brenda;
and it is suggestively told us of the old Udaller, their sire, that
he liked his graver damsel better in the walk without doors,
and his merry maiden better by the fireside; and that if he
preferred Brenda after the glass circulated in the evening, he
gave the preference to Minna before noon. So with Molly and
Cynthia in “Wives and Daughters:” Molly always gentle, but
very grave and silent; Cynthia merry, full of pretty mockeries,
and hardly ever silent—only this constant brilliancy became a
little tiresome in everyday life, being not the sunshiny rest of a
placid lake, so much as the “glitter of the pieces of a broken
mirror, which confuses and bewilders.” The union of what
can be harmonized of the two distinctive characters, is sure to
be engaging in no ordinary degree. As in the Beryl of
“George Geith.” “You imagine,” says Beryl, on one occasion,
“because it is necessary to my existence to laugh at
people’s oddities, that I never feel for their woes. You think,
because I have a quick sense of the ludicrous, that I have no
eyes for grief. And there you do me an injustice.” Such as
Beryl will be found to take exception to predominant levity in
the masculine gender, after the manner of the fair tenant of
Wildfell Hall: “I do wish he would be sometimes serious,”
she writes of her endeared Arthur: “I cannot get him to write
or speak in real, solid earnest. I don’t mind it now, but if it
be always so, what shall I do with the serious part of myself?”
Tired out with such companionship, a complainant in one of
Lovell Beddoes’ tragedies exclaims,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m weary of their laughter’s empty din.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Methinks, these fellows, with their ready jests,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are like to tedious bells, that ring alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marriage or death.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Rather than have her uniformly saccharine and smiling, Ben
Jonson’s Curius avowedly would have his mistress “angry
sometimes, to sweeten off the rest of her behaviour.”</p>

<p class="tb">Sir Walter Scott, in one page of his Diary, noting the break-up
of a hilarious group of guests at Abbotsford, adds the
avowal, “I am not sorry, being one of those whom too much
mirth always inclines to sadness.” Even the bright extremes
of joy, as Thomas Hood the elder words it, bring on conclusions
of disgust:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is no music in the life</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That sounds with idiot laughter solely;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s not a string attuned to mirth</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But has its chord in melancholy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Leigh Hunt tenderly tells one of his grandchildren how, when
<i>he</i> was a child, and in excessive spirits, his dear mother would
sometimes say to him, “Leigh, come and sit down here by me,
and let us try to think a little.” Better that than <i>riant sans
cesse</i>, even for a child. When I was a child, says the apostle, I
thought as a child. Thinking was not out of the question
even then, though it might, and by comparison with the man’s
it must, be childish thinking. For children as for men, a time
to laugh and a time to weep. True, there are differences of
gifts and temperaments:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To some men God hath given laughter; but tears to some men He hath given:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bade us sow in tears, hereafter to harvest holier smiles in Heaven;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tears and smiles, they are His gift: both good, to smite or to uplift.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He knows His sheep: the wind and showers beat not too sharply the shorn lamb:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wisdom is more wise than ours: He knew my nature—what I am:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He tempers smiles with tears: both good, to bear in time the Christian mood.”</div>
  </div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DISALLOWED_DESIGNS"><i>DISALLOWED DESIGNS.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> xix. 21.</p>

</div>

<p>“There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless,
the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.” Even the
counsels of the prudent He bringeth to nought. “There is no
wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel, against the Lord,”
nor any that prospers without Him. Without Him, where is
the wise? where is the scribe? What, after all, is the wisdom
of the children of this world, wiser in their generation than the
children of light? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of
this world? For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of
the wise.” Nay; unworldly wisdom, in its forming of plans,
and elaboration of schemes, and devising of devices, enjoys no
privileged immunity from failure, at the veto of Him who
chargeth His angels with folly. “L’homme propose, Dieu
dispose.” The Divine disposal of human proposals is ofttimes
very summary and entire.</p>

<p>The proverb, “Man proposes, God disposes,” is believed by
one learned in such lore to be naturalised in every nation of
Europe:—thus the Spanish, “La gente pone, y Dios dispone;”
the German, with its corresponding jingle, “Der Mensch
denkt’s, Gott lenkt’s,” etc., so deeply upon all men is impressed
the sense of Hamlet’s assertion of a Divinity that
shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will. Molière’s
shrewd-spoken Dorine enounces a truism when reminding
Damis that,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“On n’exécute pas tout ce qui se propose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et le chemin est long du projet à la chose.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A wise man endeavours, it has been said, by considering all
circumstances, to make conjectures and form conclusions: but
the smallest accident intervening (and in the course of affairs
it is impossible to foresee all) often produces such turns and
changes, that at last he is just as much in doubt of events as
the most ignorant and inexperienced person. What Shakspeare
in his sonnets calls “millioned accidents” creep in
between design and result, between plan and performance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
between scheme and issue, and “blunt the sharpest intents.”
As the old moralising poet, modernised by Dryden, puts it—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But see how Fortune can confound the wise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when they least expect it, turn the dice.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Fortune, or fate, is the popularly recognised agent in these
reversals and collapses; and subtile philosophers speculate
curiously on the plenipotent character of this agency. One
such, for example, predisposed to paradox may-be, yet no
heedless or hasty penman, affirms, that if you look closely into
the matter, it will be seen that whatever appears most vagrant,
and utterly purposeless, turns out, in the end, to have been
impelled the most surely on a preordained and unswerving
track. Chance and change, he goes on to remark, love to
deal with men’s unsettled plans, not with their idle vagaries.
So that, as he argues the matter, if we desire unexpected and
unimaginable events, we should contrive an iron framework,
such as we fancy may compel the future to take one inevitable
shape; for then comes in the unexpected, and shatters our
design in fragments.</p>

<p>The biographer of Columbus, narrating the story of his
shipwreck in 1492, describes him as passing, with his usual
excitability, from a state of doubt and anxiety to one of
sanguine anticipation, and thus coming to consider his present
misfortune as a providential event mysteriously ordained by
Heaven to work out the success of his enterprise. At once,
therefore, he began to look forward to glorious fruits to be
reaped from this seeming evil, and laid his plans accordingly.
“Such was the visionary yet generous enthusiasm of Columbus,
the moment that prospects of vast wealth broke upon his
mind. What in some spirits would have awakened a grasping
and sordid avidity to accumulate, immediately filled his
imagination with plans of magnificent expenditure. But how
vain are our attempts to interpret the inscrutable decrees of
Providence! The shipwreck, which Columbus considered the
act of Divine favour, to reveal to him the secrets of the land,
shackled and limited all his after-discoveries.” For it is shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
to have linked his fortunes, for the remainder of his life, to this
island, which was doomed to be to him a source of cares and
troubles, to involve him in a thousand perplexities, and to becloud
his declining years with humiliation and disappointment.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Le ciel agit sans nous en ces événements,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is instructive to note in the memoirs of Gabriel Naudé,
that great scholar’s exultant anticipation of the public opening
of the library he had mainly helped to form. He must have
reckoned on that day as a <i>beau jour</i> for him, the happiest day
of his life; and he arranged a fête accordingly, to be celebrated
with his most intimate friends. But that very day broke out
the public troubles of the Fronde; and barricades in the streets
of Paris ill accorded with Gabriel Naudé’s cherished hopes.
“Ainsi vont les projets humains sous l’œil d’en haut qui les
déjoue.” The Scotch ploughman-poet, eyeing the mouse and
its “wee bit housie, too, in ruin,” as turned up by his plough,
gave racy utterance to but a trite reflection, when, apostrophising
the “wee sleekit, cow’rin, tim’rous beastie,” he thus
moralised his song:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, mousie, thou art no thy lane,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In proving foresight may be vain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The best-laid schemes o’ mice an’ men</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Gang aft a-gley,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leave us nought but grief an’ pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">For promised joy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As the good friar in Shakspeare has it,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A greater power than we can contradict</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath thwarted our intents,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">well laid and discreetly devised as they seemed to be.</p>

<p>And as with the seemingly laudable plans of the prudent, so
with the arrogant designs of the self-confident. The enemy
said, “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword;
my hand shall destroy them.” Thus said the enemy, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
Pharaoh’s host, on the shores of the Red Sea. But then sang
Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord:
“Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they
sank as lead in the mighty waters.” It is but an emphasised
reading of the standard text, that the Lord bringeth the
counsel of the heathen to nought, and maketh the devices of
the people of none effect, and casteth out the counsel of
princes. Whereas, turning from man proposing to God disposing,
“The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever, and
the thoughts of His heart from generation to generation.”
The same is He of whom it is written that He turneth wise
men backwards, and maketh their knowledge foolish.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, ever a moralist, moralised his song when, at a
critical juncture in the legend of the “White Doe of Rylstone,”
he interposed this reflection:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But quick the turns of chance and change,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And knowledge has a narrow range;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence idle fears, and needless pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wishes blind, and efforts vain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For a closing variation on the present theme, a worse might
be found than this from the play within the play of “Hamlet:”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, orderly to end where I begun,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our wills, our fates, do so contrary run,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That our devices still are overthrown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, with a slight change of title and text, the same theme
is pursued, in the section next ensuing, through another fugue-course
of variations.</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> xvi. 9.</p>

</div>

<p>“A man’s heart deviseth his way; but the Lord directeth
his steps.” Man devises, God directs; man proposes,
God disposes. There is a way that seemeth right unto a man,
and practicable, plausible, easy of accomplishment, and sure of
success. But the counsel of the Lord puts a veto on the
scheme; and the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.</p>

<p>Luther charges it against princes and potentates in his day,
that when they take in hand an enterprise, they do not pray
before they begin, but set to work calculating: three times
three make nine, twice seven are fourteen—so-and-so will do
so-and-so—in this manner will the business come to a prosperous
issue: “but our Lord God says unto them, For whom
then do ye hold me? for a cypher? Do I sit here above in
vain, and to no purpose? Ye shall know, that I will twist your
accounts about finely, and make them all false reckonings.”</p>

<p>Says old Alice, in “Mary Barton,” “I sometimes think the
Lord is against planning. Whene’er I plan over much, He is
sure to send and mar all my plans, as if He would ha’ me put
the future into His hands. Afore Christmas-time I was as full
as full could be of going home for good and all; yo has heard
how I’ve wished it this terrible long time.... Many a
winter’s night did I lie awake and think that, please God,
come summer, I’d go home at last. Little did I think how
God Almighty would baulk me for not leaving my days in His
hands, who had led me through the wilderness hitherto.” It
is very like Rousseau to say, in reference to a fully determined
project of his, for the fulfilment of which nothing was wanting
but “ce qui ne dépend pas des hommes dans les projets les
mieux concertés,”—that “on dirait qu’il n’y a que les noirs
complots des méchants qui réussissent; les projets innocents
des bons n’ont presque jamais d’accomplissement.” But who
can hope for anything like contentment, as Mr. Helps somewhere
asks, so long as he continues to attach that ridiculous
degree of importance to the events of this life which so many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
people are inclined to do? Observe, he bids us, the effect
which it has upon them: they are most uncomfortable if their
little projects do not turn out according to their fancy—nothing
is to be angular to them—they regard external things as the
only realities; and as they have fixed their abode here, they
must have it arranged to their mind. Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu assures one of her correspondents that never had she
been so little mistress of her own time and actions as since she
lived alone; and going on to account for this, she observes,
“Mankind is placed in a state of dependency, not only on one
another (which all are in some degree), but so many inevitable
accidents thwart our designs and limit our best-laid projects.”
The poor efforts of our utmost prudence, and political schemes,
she fancies must appear in the eyes of some superior beings,
like the pecking of a young linnet to break a wire cage, or the
climbing of a squirrel in a hoop. If to this bit of morality
from the greatest of lady letter-writers in England, a parallel
passage may readily be cited from the greatest of lady letter-writers
in France, there is a characteristic difference, in the
tone of religious feeling, conspicuous generally by its absence
in Lady Mary’s case, but a pervading, though underlying, force
in that of Madame de Sévigné. The latter describes on one
occasion the “cruel derangement” of her family plans, so
nicely arranged, and so ripe for completion; then adds, if with
a sigh, with a sigh of gentle resignation, “La Providence le veut
ainsi. Elle est tellement maitresse de toutes nos actions, que
nous n’exécutons rien que sous son bon plaisir, et je tache de
ne faire de projets que le moins qu’il m’est possible, afin de
n’être pas si souvent trompée; car qui compte sans elle
compte deux fois.” How vain, exclaims the author of “Destiny,”
are all our schemes for futurity! Human wisdom exhausts
itself in devising what a higher Power shows to be
vanity. We decide for to-day, and a passing moment scatters
our decisions as chaff before the wind. We resolve for to-morrow,
to-morrow comes but to root up our resolutions. We
scheme for our works to remain monuments of our power and
wisdom, and the most minute, the most trivial event is sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
to overturn all our purposes, and cast down to the dust
the thoughts and the labours of a life. Truly, “it is not in
man that walketh to direct his steps.”</p>

<p>Were the affairs of this world to be guided implicitly by
human wisdom, suggests one of Scott’s sententious doctors of
divinity, or were they uniformly to fall out according to the
conjectures of human foresight, events would no longer be
under the domination of that time and chance which happen
unto all men; since we should, in the one case, work out our
own purposes to a certainty, by our own skill; and, in the
other, regulate our conduct according to the views of unerring
prescience. “But man is, while in this vale of tears, like an
uninstructed bowler, so to speak, who thinks to attain the jack
by delivering the bowl straightforward upon it, being ignorant
that there is a concealed bias within the spheroid, which will
make it, in all probability, swerve away, and lose the cast.”
The future, in the words of a later fiction, is not a blank sheet
of paper, for us to write any story we please upon, but a wonderful
chart, mapped out by a Divine and unerring hand.</p>

<p>When Mr. Thackeray propounds the query, Who can foresee
everything, and always? and returns his own answer (a
sufficiently safe one), Not the wisest amongst us,—he does so
in reference to the counsels of the worldly woman who governed
and directed the Newcome family; which counsels bore results
so different from what that elderly lady desired, and
foresaw. And he proceeds to point his moral by the tale of a
French king’s fall. “When his majesty, Louis XIV., jockied
his grandson on to the throne of Spain (founding thereby the
present revered dynasty of that country), did he expect to
peril his own, and bring all Europe about his royal ears?
Could a late King of France, eager for the advantageous establishment
of one of his darling sons, and anxious to procure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
a beautiful Spanish princess, with a crown and kingdom in
reversion, for the simple and obedient youth, ever suppose that
the welfare of his whole august race and reign would be upset
by that smart speculation?” The master of irony professes to
take only the most noble examples to illustrate the conduct of
such a noble old personage as her ladyship of Kew, who
brought a prodigious deal of trouble upon some of the innocent
members of her family, whom no doubt she thought to better
in life by her experienced guidance, and undoubted worldly
wisdom. We may be as deep as Jesuits, he continues,—may
know the world ever so well, lay the best ordered plans, and
the profoundest combinations,—and by a certain not unnatural
turn of fate, we, and our plans and combinations, are sent
flying before the wind. “We may be as wise as Louis
Philippe, that many counselled Ulysses whom the respectable
world admired so; and after years of patient scheming, and
prodigies of skill; after coaxing, wheedling, doubling, bullying
wisdom, behold, yet stronger powers interpose: and schemes
and skill and violence are nought.” As Schiller’s Wallenstein

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_PURSEBEARERS_PROTEST_AGAINST_PURPOSELESS_WASTE"><i>A PURSEBEARER’S PROTEST AGAINST PURPOSELESS WASTE.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. John</span> xii. 5.</p>

</div>

<p>It was very costly ointment of spikenard that Mary took
and anointed therewith the feet of Jesus, so that the house
was filled with the odour of the ointment. So costly, that it
set one of His apostles to work, counting the cost. Judas
Iscariot was this ready reckoner. He was conversant with
figures. He was the pursebearer of the apostolic circle, and
knew, it seems, how and when and why to keep a tight finger
on the purse-strings. The wasted contents—waste he accounted
it—of that alabaster box might have been sold for three hundred
denarii, and the proceeds given to the poor. As pursebearer
he protested. And nominally his protest was in behalf
of the poor.</p>

<p>Referring to that text in Exodus which tells how the people
brought much more than enough for the service of the work
which the Lord commanded to make, the question was put by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
a divine who, being dead, yet speaketh: When will the earth
again hear that glad announcement? Yet, until we bring
more than enough, he said, at least until there is kindled in us
a spirit which will make us desire to do so, we shall never
bring enough. “And ought we not? Your economists will say
<i>No.</i> They who would think the sun a useful creature, if he
would come down from the sky and light their fires, will gravely
reprehend such wasteful extravagance.” This last figure of
speech has its parallel in Mr. Carlyle’s estimate of “the uses
of this Dante:” he declines to say much about his “uses;”
he holds that an influence working, like Dante’s, into the
depths of our existence, and feeding through long times the
life-roots of all excellent things whatsoever, is not to be very
satisfactorily computed by “utilities.” Dante shall therefore
be invaluable, or of no value: “We will not estimate the sun
by the quantity of gas-light it saves us.”</p>

<p>Judas the pursebearer was, as a French divine characterizes
him, <i>exact</i>, <i>positif</i>, <i>calculateur</i>; one who habituated himself to
compute everything by a ready-money standard, and to appraise
every action by the rule of immediate utility. He
might be accurate to a fraction in his reckoning of what that
“wasted” ointment would have fetched in the market; but,
had not his heart been already in some sort ossified, he would
have comprehended that “au dessus de l’utile il y a le beau, et
au dessus du calcul le dévouement, et qu’ à une âme qui déborde
d’une joie extraordinaire il faut des moyens extraordinaires
aussi pour exprimer ce qu’elle éprouve. Judas a
perdu le sens des réalités purement spirituelles, qui lui paraissent
vagues, parce que, comme l’infini, elles résistent aux
chiffres.”</p>

<p>When Dr. Justus Jonas told Dr. Martin Luther of a certain
potent landholder, who said to Duke John Frederic, when
commending to him the gospel of Christ, “Sir, the gospel
pays no interest,”—“Have you no grains?” was Luther’s interrogative
comment,—citing the words of the swine at the
lion’s feast, when invited to feast on recondite dainties. Even
so, said Dr. Martin, there are inveterate worldlings who, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
invited to the spiritual feast of fat things well refined, “turn
up their snouts, and ask for guilders. Offer a cow nutmeg,
and she will reject it for old hay.”</p>

<p>It is a too true bill of indictment against the mass of men,
that, knowing that two and two make four, and that four is of a
higher value than three, they practically conclude, carrying out
into practice the conclusion, that to amass is to become wealthy,
and that to bestow is to become the poorer. With this arithmetic
the children of this world are wise in their generation,
and add field to field, house to house, to some purpose. But
by what right, asks a voice from the sanctuary, do they take
upon themselves to pronounce on such qualities and realities as
devotion and charity, as detachment from the “good things of
this life” and renunciation of indulgence to the senses? If
they witness a deed of noble self-sacrifice, they can but wag
their heads, in shocked surprise and bewilderment at such a
blunder in arithmetic, <i>une telle faute de calcul</i>. “Ils ne comprennent
pas qu’on puisse soupirer après d’autres biens que
ceux de la matière, après d’autres vérités que celles de l’arithmétique.”
There are many, very many more things than are
dreamt of in their philosophy; dreaming, indeed, is rather out
of their way; and perhaps philosophy too, for the matter of that.</p>

<p>Coleridge, denouncing the “moral” consequences of Napoleon’s
tyranny, as far more to be dreaded than the worst of
those outward and calculable evils, which chiefly shock the
imaginations of men, is out of all patience with such objections
as, “What <i>good</i> will the Tyrolese do themselves by their
heroic resistance?” “What are the Spaniards fighting for?”
etc.,—as if man were made only to eat above ground, and be
eaten; as if we had no dignity to preserve, no conscience to
obey, no immortality to expect.</p>

<p>What good can it do him? demands the vulgar fine lady in
“Cecil,” who hears that a certain well-to-do man of genius has
written a book. A man, she argues, writes for money or distinction:
what can be this man’s object? he don’t want to be
made a baronet, nor does he want to increase his income.
Where can be the <i>use</i> of writing? And where, she is (by cross-questioning)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
answered, can be the use to the aloe of its flower,
to the mine of its gold? Oldbuck of Monkbarns might have
done worse than parody, as he did, the “brutal ignorance” of
your <i>cui bono</i> querists of the baser sort, in the strain of
Gray’s Bard,—</p>

<p>That a new machine, a new experiment, the discovery of a
salt, or of a bone, should, in England, receive a wider homage,
than the most profound speculation from which no obvious
results are apprehended,—this way of contemplating affairs
Mr. Buckle was prompt to own as certainly productive of great
good. But he also took care to declare it to be, with equal
certainty, a one-sided way, satisfying a part only of the human
mind—many of the noblest intellects craving for something
which it cannot supply. There are mortals who, as a clerical
essayist has said, cannot understand or sympathise with the
gratification arising from a study of graceful and beautiful
objects; who think that the supply of animal necessities is all
that any man (but themselves, perhaps) can need. What more
can he want? they exclaim, if the man be well-fed, and well-dressed,
and well-lodged. Why, if he had been a horse or a
pig, is the answer, he would have wanted nothing more; but
the possession of a rational soul brings with it pressing wants
which are not of a material nature, not to be supplied by
material things, and not felt by pigs and horses. And the
craving for surrounding objects of grace and beauty is held to
be one of these. Mr. Emerson, in his far-going way, goes so
far as to say, as regards the “base rate at which the highest
mental and moral gifts are held” in his country,—that let a
man attain the highest and broadest culture that any American
has possessed, then let him die by sea-storm, railroad collision,
or other accident, “and all America will acquiesce that the
best thing has happened to him; that, after the education has
gone far, such is the expensiveness of America, that the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
use to put a fine person to, is, to drown him to save his board.”
M. de Tocqueville somewhere observes, that to cross almost
impenetrable forests, to swim deep rivers, to encounter pestilential
marshes, to sleep exposed to the damp air of the
woods,—these are efforts which an American easily conceives,
if a dollar is to be gained by them—that is the point; but
that a man should take such journeys from curiosity, he cannot
understand. The German poet is often cited for his remark,
that the Cow of Isis is to some the divine symbol of knowledge,
to others but the milch cow, only regarded for the pounds of
butter she will yield. An English sympathiser exclaims, “O
tendency of our age, to look on Isis as the milch cow! Gaze
on the goddess,” he bids a sordid aspirant, “and get ready the
churn and thy scales, and let us see what butter will fetch in
the market.” When Judge Haliburton’s typical Yankee is
asked by the old minister what he thinks of Niagara, and
forthwith expatiates on the “grand spec” it offers for factory
purposes—for carding mills, fulling mills, cotton mills, grain
mills, saw mills, plaster mills, and never a want of water for
any or all of them, his pastor upbraids him with almost sacrilege
in that style of talk; exclaiming, “How that dreadful thirst of
gain has absorbed all other feelings in our people, when such
an idea could be entertained for a moment! It [Niagara] is a
grand spectacle, it is the voice of nature in the wilderness,
proclaiming to the untutored tribes there of the power and
majesty and glory of God.... Talk not to me of
mills, factories, and machinery, sir, nor of introducing the
money-changers into the temple of the Lord.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LIGHT_AT_EVENING-TIME"><i>LIGHT AT EVENING-TIME.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Zechariah</span> xiv. 7.</p>

</div>

<p>The promise, or prediction, to be found in the words of
the son of Berechiah, that “at evening-time it shall be
light,” is gratefully accepted by devout souls in perhaps a
strained and wrested sense; but a sense so comforting, so full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
of tenderness and beauty, that one is fain to believe the words
may favour, if they cannot be said to warrant, this “accommodation
of Scripture.” Divines are fain to give technical
divinity the go-by for the nonce, while, as they confess, the
deepening twilight seldom fails to suggest to them this cheering
promise, a promise which “tells how the Christian’s day shall
end, how the day of life may be somewhat overcast and dreary,
but light shall come on the darkened way at last.” In the same
spirit are welcome the words of Amos, the herdsman of Tekoa,
concerning One who turneth the shadow of death into the
morning. To Him the darkness and the light are both alike;
and at His bidding, when despondent sufferers are in a horror
of great darkness, and say surely the darkness shall cover
them,—even the night shall be light about them; and in some
sort to them, even as to Him, the night shineth as the day; or
at least, in the language of Zechariah, there is light, which if
not clear, is yet not dark; neither wholly day nor night, but
twilight—soft, soothing, tranquillizing—instead of the dreaded
darkness which may be felt. Even thus He brings the blind by
a way that they knew not, making darkness light before them.</p>

<p>Even thus, at the last, He delivers them who through fear of
death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. Bunyan exemplifies
such in Mr. Fearing, the pilgrim, who at the entrance
of the Valley of the Shadow of Death was “ready to die for
fear.” But the valley was quiet from troublers. “I suppose
those enemies here had now a special check from our Lord,
and a command not to meddle until Mr. Fearing had passed
over it.” “And here also I took notice of what was very remarkable—the
water of that river was lower at this time than
ever I saw it in all my life; so he went over at last, not much
above wetshod.</p>

<p>“<i>Honesty</i>: Then it seems he was well at last?”</p>

<p>“<i>Greatheart</i>: Yes, yes; I never had a doubt about it.”</p>

<p>Often, observes Schleiermacher in one of his letters, the last
radiant moment is called rapidly into being, even in souls
wherein the eternal Light has not always shone with bright
effulgence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>Biographers of Dr. Johnson tell us how, when at length the
moment, dreaded through so many years, came close, the dark
cloud passed away from his mind; how his temper became unusually
patient and gentle, and he ceased to think with terror
of death, and of that which lieth beyond death, and spoke
much of the mercy of God and of the propitiation of Christ.
One might apply to him in effect the lines of the poet of the
Seasons.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Joy seized his withered veins, and one bright gleam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of setting life shone on her evening hours.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meditating on various senses in which the words of the
promise of light at evening-time speak truly, in which its great
principle holds good, the signal blessing shall come when it is
needed most and expected least, Dr. Boyd, thinks mainly
how sometimes, at the close of the chequered and sober day,
the Better Sun has broken through the clouds and made the
flaming west all purple and gold. He pictures the chamber
of death, while hushed and mournful gazers see also the summer
sun in glory going down. “But it is only to us who remain
that the evening darkness is growing, only for us that the
sun is going down.” As the evening falls on us, but not on
the departing believer; as the shadows deepen on us, but not on
him; as the darkness gathers on us, but not on him; the “glorious
promise has found its perfect fulfilment, that ‘at the evening-time
there shall be light.’”</p>

<p>Secular literature has its analogous instances. Dr. Holmes
describes Elsie Venner’s storm-tossed, vagrant spirit as composed
and serene at the last; the cold glitter died out of the
diamond eyes, and the stormy scowl disappeared from the dark
brows. “It seemed to her father as if the malign influence—evil
spirit it might almost be called—which had pervaded her
being had at last been driven forth or exorcised,” and that the
tears she now shed were “at once the sign and the pledge of
her redeemed nature. But now she was to be soothed and not
excited. After her tears she slept again, and the look her face
wore was peaceful as never before.” And the devoted father,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
to whom her life-long career had been until now a perturbing
trial, now thanked God for the brief interval of peace which
had been granted her, and for the sweet communion they had
enjoyed in these last days. There are those of whom it may
be said that it comes to pass, when midday is over, and they
cast wistful glances, and perhaps even reproachful petitions
heavenwards, until evening-time, that there is from above
neither voice, nor any to answer, nor seemingly any that regardeth;
but with evening-time comes an answer and comes
light. Applicable to the subject, in this sense, are the lines in
“Paracelsus,” on one who lived without God in the world:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then died, grown old; and just an hour before—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Having lain long with blank and soulless eyes—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sate up suddenly, and with natural voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said, that in spite of thick air and closed doors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God told him it was June.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of Margaret Arundel, in “The Gordian Knot,” we read, in
her hour of household desolation and distress, that could we
have seen her fair face, now pale with pain, now flushed with
emotion, we should have pitied her; but “it may be that some
superior intelligence witnessed her suffering, and pitied her not;
knowing that all she was to undergo was but the fiery trial
destined for those for whom in the evening there is light.”
Stephen Blackpool, in “Hard Times,” who has found life “aw
a muddle,” and meets with his death in the pit, is tranquillized
with light at the last—light which he identifies with the star
that shone upon him while he lay mangled in the old shaft.
“Often as I coom to myseln, and found it shinin’ on me down
there in my trouble, I thowt it were the very star as guided to
our Saviour’s home. I awmost think it be the very star.”
His rescuers lift him up, and he is overjoyed to find they are
about to take him in the direction whither the star seems to
him to lead. Very gently they carry him along the fields and
down the lanes; but it is soon a funeral procession. “The
star had shown him where to find the God of the poor; and
through humility and sorrow and forgiveness, he had gone to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
his Saviour’s rest.” It is not every life the early prime of
which has been blissful enough to warrant the exclamation,—</p>

<p>Cellini opens his autobiography with a placid record of the
enjoyment of his present lot, in life’s decline, in contrast with
the storms and turmoil of his previous course. We read of
James Watt, that not until he had reached what is termed the
grand climacteric of man’s life did he know real freedom from
bodily infirmities; and that his spirits became more equable as
the principal causes of his anxiety and occasional depression
were removed; so that although he was destined to be one of
those “who are so strong that they come to fourscore years,”
his strength even then, while it could scarcely be termed
“labour,” was certainly very far from “sorrow.” The cloud
which had so long hung over him was gently lifted up, and the
curtain parted, to disclose a happier scene. “It is curious
that even physical ease and enjoyment should come so late;
but so it was. The term which commenced with his release
from the evils of active business was a serene and golden time,
in which he found repose”—with the softening retrospect of a
struggle past and a victory won. John Galt, in “The Entail,”
exemplifies a kindred experience in the widow Walkinshaw,
whose deliverance from an all but lifelong thraldom, late in the
day as it came, yet came in time enough to “allow the original
brightness of her mind to shine out in the evening with a
serene and pleasing lustre.”</p>

<p>Dr. Boyd quotes the dying speech of a poor English day
labourer, than which, he affirms, few sentences ever touched
him more with their hopeless pathos: “Wut wi’ faeth, and wut
wi’ the earth goin’ round the sun, and wut wi’ the railways all
a-whuzzing and a-buzzing, I’m clean muddled, confoozled,
and bet!” It is Stephen Blackpool again in spirit, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
letter. With that sentence the dying man is said to have
feebly turned to the wall, and spoken no more. “Well, let us
hope that light came at the evening-time upon that blind,
benighted way.”</p>

<p>Among the dying words of Mrs. Schimmelpenninck, honourably
known by her “Memoirs of Port Royal,” and other works,
the remark is preserved that she had often in her life been
inclined to occupy herself with the prospect close at hand,
from finding the bleak, hard outline of the eternal hills cold
and barren to her sight; but that, as she drew nearer, God’s
mercy made His light to shine full upon them, so that she
could now perceive they were covered with magnificent trees
of the forest, and were rich in fruit and flowers far more
pleasant than those close at hand, and yet a continuation of
them.</p>

<p>A commentator on the text of “promised light at evening-time,”
explains that by evening is understood the gradual
withdrawal of the light; it is the lessening light that makes the
evening-time: because of <i>that</i> the daisies close, and the birds
fly to their nests, and a hush comes over nature. And it is
just because evening is the time when, in the ordinary course
of things, the light is going and the darkness is coming, that
there is found to be anything remarkable in the text of <i>um den
Abend wird es licht seyn</i>, as Luther’s version runs. The
promise, or prophecy, is that “light shall come at a time when
it is not natural, when in the common course of things it is not
looked for.” It would be no surprise, as this divine proceeds
to remark, that light should come at noonday: we expect it
then, it is just what we are accustomed to see. “But if, when
the twilight shadows were falling deeper and deeper, ...
with a sudden burst the noonday light were to spread around,—that
would be a surprise.” One of his personal illustrations
of its import is the instance of the Christian poet who passed
away almost in despair,—the gloom that overshadowed his
spirit enduring almost to the end: “but even in the last
moment there came a wonderful change”—and they tell us
how even on his dead face there remained, till it was hidden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
for ever, a look of bright and beautiful and sudden surprise;
the reflection of that light at evening that had been long in
coming, but had come at last. At eventide light may break
forth as the morning; light rising in obscurity, and darkness
becoming as the noonday.</p>

<p>Light in darkness—light springing up out of darkness—the
blessedness of this is emphatically recognised both by signal
example and in special promise, in Holy Writ. When the
hand of Moses was stretched out toward heaven, and darkness
fell over the land of Egypt, even darkness which might be felt—a
thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days—the
Egyptians saw not one another, neither rose any from his place
for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their
dwellings. “When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light
unto me.” “For thou wilt light my candle; the Lord my God
will enlighten my darkness.” In the same Psalm that tells how
clouds and darkness are round about Him, the Father of
lights, is contained the exulting assurance, that “light is sown
for the righteous.” The light of the righteous rejoiceth, when
the lamp of the wicked hath been put out. Well may spiritual
aspirations be fervent for light to be sent forth, to lead and to
guide to His holy hill and tabernacle, lest the feet of the wayfarer
slip in a way that he knows not; and, above all, when
they stumble on the dark mountains, or lose their footing in the
swelling of Jordan.</p>

<p><i>Lux è tenebris</i>—who will not prize it? who does not need it?
For—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent12">“What am I?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An infant crying in the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An infant <i>crying for the light</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with no language but a cry.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An exceeding bitter cry this crying for the light sometimes
is, in such as those, for instance, whom Robertson of Brighton
describes as “turning from side to side,” feeling with horror the
old, and all they hold dear, crumbling away—the ancient light
going out—more than half suspecting the falsehood of the rest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
and with an earnestness amounting to agony, leaving their
home, like the Magians, and inquiring for fresh light.</p>

<p>Turning from side to side, with the wailing note of interrogation,
“Who will show us any good?” And then, more
earnestly than ever, “Lord, lift Thou up the <span class="smcap">light</span> of Thy countenance
upon us.” In vain we turn from side to side. To
whom should we go but unto Thee? Turn us again, O Lord
God of hosts; show the <span class="smcap">light</span> of Thy countenance, and we
shall be saved.</p>

<p>Observable for special application is what Locke makes
observable as a general fact, that new-born children always turn
their eyes to that part whence the light comes, lay them how
you please.</p>

<p>When the blind are operated on for the restoration of sight,
it is suggestively remarked by an eminent author, that the
same succouring hand which has opened to them the visible
world, immediately shuts out the bright prospect again for a
time, a bandage being passed over the eyes, lest in the first
tenderness of their recovered sense, they should be fatally
affected by the sudden transition from darkness to light. But,
as he goes on to say, between the awful blank of total privation
of vision, and the temporary blank of vision merely
veiled, there lies the widest difference. “In the moment of
their restoration the blind have but one glimpse of light, flashing
on them in an overpowering gleam of brightness, which the
thickest, closest veiling cannot extinguish. The new darkness is
not like the void darkness of old: it is filled with rapid, changing
visions of brilliant colours and ever-varying forms, rising,
falling, whirling hither and thither with every second.” And
thus is it made evident that even when the handkerchief is
passed over them, the once sightless eyes, though bandaged
fast, are yet not blinded as they were before. All the more,
however, they now dread the blankness of that total eclipse,
now that, as it were, to them that walked in the shadow of
death, light is sprung up. Light, how much the more precious
for that background of blackness of darkness, darkness that still
may be felt!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<p>Light that may be felt, is the theme of blind old Œdipus, in
Sophocles, at the hour of his mysterious departure—the hour
and the power of darkness. Farewell he bids to—</p>

<p>Immortal as Homer is the prayer of his Ajax to die, if die
he must, in the light. Contrast with this the <i>modus moriendi</i> of
Pompey the Great, as pictured in Corneille:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“D’un des pans de sa robe it couvre son visage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A son mauvais dentin en aveugle obéit,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So with the Greek wife in Landor’s Hellenics, who resists the
bidding to fall not on her knees, but to look up:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent30">“The hand</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But to die in the light is the almost universal craving. “As a
matter of fact, nothing,” it has been remarked, “is more common
than the craving and demand for light a little before
death;” a remark confirmed by the sad experience of many who
have tended and watched the last moments of a friend. “What
more frequent than a prayer to open the shutters, and let in
the sun? What complaint more repeated, and more touching
than that ‘it is growing dark’?” We are told of a sufferer who
did not seem in immediate danger, suddenly ordering the sick
room to be lit up as for a gala. When this was mentioned to
the physician, he said, gravely, “No worse sign.” We all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
remember the tenor of the last words of Dr. Adam, of the High
School, Edinburgh, as recorded (however variously) by Scott
and Lord Cockburn and others. It was in his bed-chamber,
and in the forenoon, that he died; and finding that he could
not see, the old schoolmaster, believing himself in the familiar
school-room, exclaimed, “It is getting dark, boys; we must
put off the rest till to-morrow.” It was the darkness of death.
And to the living, to-morrow, above all, <i>that</i> to-morrow, never
comes.</p>

<p>M. de Lescure, dying of the wounds he had received at the
battle of Chollet, awaited with his usual serenity the advent of
his last hour. “Open the windows,” said he to his wife, who
was watching by his bedside, “is it clear?” “Yes,” she said,
“the sun is shining.” “I have, then,” replied the dying
general, “a veil before my eyes.” A veil that no man could
raise. Chateaubriand, in describing the last hours of his sister,
Madame de Beaumont—the Lucile of his “Memoires d’outre-tombe”—incidentally
relates that “she begged of me to open
the window.... A ray of sunshine rested upon her bed,
and seemed to rejoice her spirit.” The same circumstance is
related of the dying Emperor Alexander. So it is of Dr. Channing.
Karl Ludwig Sand, on the scaffold, begged that the
bandage over his eyes might be so placed that he could, until
his last moment, see the light. And it was so. Turner’s
biographer tells us that almost at the very hour of the old
painter’s death, his landlady wheeled his chair to the window,
that he might see the sunshine he had loved so much, mantling
the river, and glowing on the sails of the passing boats. “The
old painter died with the winter-morning sun shining upon his
face, as he was lying in his bed. The attendant drew up the
window-blind, and the morning sun shone on the dying artist—the
sun he had so often beheld with such love and such veneration,”
and painted, at sundry times and in divers manners,
with such force.</p>

<p>Rousseau’s wish, when in a dying state, to be carried into
the open air, that he might have “a parting look at the glorious
orb of day,” is referred to by one of the many biographers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
Robert Burns, in recording that poet’s remark one beautiful
evening, when the sun was shining brightly through the casement.
The hand of death was then upon him, and a young
friend rose to let down the window-blinds, fearing the light
might be too much for him. Burns thanked her, with a look
of great benignity, but prayed her to let the sun shine on: “he
will not shine long for me.”</p>

<p>Tender and true is the pathos in one of Mrs. Richard Trench’s
letters, touching the death of her endeared child, Bessy, where
we read: “The last phrase she uttered, except those expressive
of her latest wants and pain, was a desire the window-curtain
might be withdrawn, that she might look at the stars.” Sunlight
or starlight, it is light we cherish, and that cherishes us. Light
from the first, light to the last. Happy, if the light we cherish
is the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect
day.</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Acts</span> xxvii. 29.</p>

</div>

<p>It was in a ship of Alexandria, sailing into Italy, when sailing
was now dangerous, because of the advanced season;
it was during a voyage which Paul, a passenger, foresaw and
foretold would be with hurt and much damage, not only of the
lading and ship, but also of lives two hundred threescore and
sixteen; it was after there had arisen against the ship a tempestuous
wind called Euroclydon, before which the vessel became
a helpless drift; then it was that the crew and passengers,
exceedingly tossed with the tempest, and not comforted—except
the apostle, gave up, with the same exception, all hope of
escape, and gloomily awaited the bitter end. On the third
day they cast out the tackling of the ship. And when neither
sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
on them, all hope that they should be saved was then taken
away. The fourteenth night was come, and they were driven
up and down in Adria, and about midnight the shipmen
deemed that they drew near to some country, and sounded
once and again, and found reason to fear lest they should have
fallen upon rocks. So they cast four anchors out of the stern,
and <i>wished for the day</i>—ηὔχοντο ἡμέραν γενέσθαι. If ’tis double
death to die in sight of shore, as Shakspeare says, it is also, or
nearly, double death to die in the dark. Some would almost
say, Surely the bitterness of death is past, if light be vouchsafed
to the dying, and so the shadows flee away. Well can
they understand a pregnant symbolism in that incident of
patriarchal days, when a deep sleep fell upon Abram as the
sun was going down; and, lo, a horror of a great darkness fell
upon him. With something of a shuddering sympathy can
they connect the fact that, on the day whence all Good Fridays
take their name, there was darkness over all the land unto the
ninth hour, with that other fact that about the ninth hour there
was heard a wailing cry, whose echo reverberates through all
space and time, <i>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</i></p>

<p>Ever memorable in classical lore is the supplication of the
Greek warrior in Homer, not to die in the dark. Let him see
his foe, and see his end, however imminent, however inevitable.
King Edward II., in Christopher Marlowe’s historical
tragedy, left alone in the Berkeley Castle dungeon with Lightborn,
a murderer, exclaims:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I see my tragedy written in thy brows;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet stay awhile, forbear thy bloody hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let me see the stroke before it comes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That even then, when I shall lose my life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My mind may be more steadfast on my God.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Frequent in historical narrative are instances like that of
Labedoyère, who when brought out to be shot, refused to have
his eyes bandaged, and looking straight at the levelled muskets,
exclaimed in a loud voice, “Fire, my friends!” Marshal
Ney, a week or two later, also refused to have his eyes bandaged.
“For five-and-twenty years,” he said, “I have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
accustomed to face the balls of the enemy.” Then taking off
his hat with his left hand, and placing his right upon his heart,
he too said in a loud voice, fronting the soldiers, “My comrades,
fire on me.” Murat fell in a like manner, after a like
request,—but gazing to the last on a medallion which contained
portraits of his wife and four children.</p>

<p>What mainly tends to pile up the agony of Goisvintha, in
the historical romance of “Antonina,” when alone in the vaults
with the madman Ulpius, is the distracting absence of light.
“Bewildered and daunted by the darkness and mystery around
her, she vainly strained her eyes to look through the obscurity,
as Ulpius drew her on into the recess.... Suddenly he
heard her pause, as if panic-stricken in the darkness, and her
voice ascended to him, groaning, ‘Light, light! oh, where is
the light?’” She is held forth at this crisis, as a terrible
evidence of the debasing power of crime, as she now stands,
enfeebled by the weight of her own avenging guilt, and “by
the agency of darkness, whose perils the innocent and the
weak have been known to brave.” It is only your melodramatic
villain that flings forth his flourish in the style of Velasquez in
“Braganza,”—addressing the duke, his judge:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yes, in your gloomiest dungeons plunge me down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Welcome, congenial darkness! horrors, hail!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No more these loathing eyes shall see that sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose irksome beams light up thy pageant triumph.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And thus Sir Walter Scott has full warranty for proving the
exceptional courage of his captive Englishman, when subjected
to a midnight trial in the vaults of the <i>Vehmgericht</i>, by showing
him unappalled by even the utter darkness of that terrible
court. “Even in these agitating circumstances, the mind of
the undaunted Englishman remained unshaken, and his eyelid
did not quiver nor his heart beat quicker, though he seemed,
according to the expression of Scripture, to be a pilgrim in the
valley of the shadow of death, beset by numerous snares, and
encompassed by total darkness, where light was most necessary
for safety.” It is only in an oblique sense that what Euripides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
says is true, of the coward being very valiant in the dark—ἐν
ὄρφνῃ δραπέτης μέγα σθένει.</p>

<p>Dr. Croly applies the Homeric prayer of Ajax to an incident
in the long war with France, when twenty-seven thousand
British were eager, under Abercrombie and the Duke of York,
to attack the French lines, and at the first tap of the drum a
general cheer was given from all the columns. But the day,
we read, had scarcely broke when a dense fog fell suddenly
upon the whole horizon, and rendered movement almost impossible.
“Nothing could exceed the vexation of the army at
this impediment, and if our soldiers had ever heard of Homer
there would have been many a repetition of his warrior’s
prayer, that ‘live or die, it might be in the light of day.’” One
is reminded of the lines in Racine:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Enfin toute l’horreur d’un combat ténébreux;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Que pouvait la valeur dans ce trouble funeste?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has been observed of a certain railway catastrophe, where
the crash and collision occurred in a tunnel—in that very place
which nobody, even on ordinary occasions, passes through
without a slight shudder and an undefined dread of some such
disaster as the one in question—that “Ajax’s prayer has been
muttered by many who never heard of Ajax; and if we are to
die, it is at least a mitigation of the hour of fate when it overtakes
us in daylight.”</p>

<p>In tracing, psychologically, the development within us of the
sense of awe, Professor Newman attributes to the gloom of
night (<i>deadly night</i>, as Homer terms it), more universally perhaps
than to any other phenomenon, the first awakening of an
uneasy sense of vastness. A young child, as he says, accustomed
to survey the narrow limits of a lighted room, wakes in
the night, and is frightened at the dim vacancy. “No nurse’s
tales about spectres are needed to make the darkness awful.”
Nor, he adds, is it from fear of any human or material enemy:
it is the negation, the unknown, the unlimited, which excites
and alarms; and sometimes the more if mingled with glimpses
of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p>The last words audible of Goethe were, “<i>More light!</i>” The
final darkness grew apace, in the words of his ablest biographer;
and he whose eternal longings had been for more
light, gave a parting cry for it as he was passing under the
shadow of death.</p>

<p>“Light! give me more light,” is the cry of the dying woman
in “The Dead Secret,”—whereby hangs that tale. How often
Lord Lytton remarks, is “light!” the last word of those
round whom the shades are gathering. And he says it in
reference to the last hours of one of the characters he has described
with most success as well as elaboration, John Burley,
who discourses of what is precious in light, as the darkness
closes about him. When he lies down, and the attendant
would withdraw the light, he moves uneasily. “Not that,” he
murmurs, “light to the last!” And putting forth a wan hand,
he draws aside the curtain, so that the light may fall full on his
face. When his only friend returns, and steals back to Burley’s
room on tiptoe, it is to see light stream through the cottage
lattice—not the miserable ray lit by a human hand—but the
still and holy effulgence of a moonlit heaven. Burley has died
in sleep—calmly, and the half open eyes have the look of inexpressible
softness which death sometimes leaves; “and still
they were turned towards the light; and the light burned clear.”
Which things are an allegory.</p>

<p>Mr. Dickens intensifies the wretchedness of his prisoner at
Marseilles by the deprivation of light in a prison that, like a
well, like a vault, like a tomb, had no knowledge of the brightness
outside, and would have kept its polluted atmosphere
intact, in one of the spice islands of the Indian Ocean. What
light he does get comes languishing down a square funnel
that blinds a window in the staircase wall, through which the
sky is never seen—nor anything else. What he does see of
the “light of day” he calls the light of yesterday week, the
light of six months ago, the light of six years ago: so slack
and dead. Bitter indeed is the import of the curse, “Let
it look for light and have none.” Piteous indeed is the import
of the pathetic remonstrance, “Wherefore is light given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
to him in misery?” Graphic indeed is the description of a
place “where the light is as darkness.” Darkness and light
are both alike to One only.</p>

<p>The record of the last day in the life of Patrick Fraser
Tytler opens as follows:—“On Sunday, the 23rd, he grew
confused in memory, experienced difficulty in swallowing, and
complained of darkness. The curtain was drawn, and the
light of the winter morning was suffered to stream on his bed;
but in vain. He folded his hands, and exclaimed, ‘I see how
it is.’”</p>

<p>John Foxe relates this incident in his narrative of the martyrdom
of William Hunter, apprentice to a silk weaver in
London, but discharged from his master’s employment for refusing
to attend mass, and finally condemned to the stake as an
incorrigible heretic. “Then said William, ‘Son of God, shine
upon me!’ and immediately the sun in the element shone out
of a dark cloud so full in his face that he was constrained to
look another way, whereat the people mused, because it was
dark a little time before.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MORE_THAN_BROTHERHOOD_OF_A_BOSOM_FRIEND"><i>THE MORE THAN BROTHERHOOD OF A BOSOM FRIEND.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> xviii. 24.</p>

</div>

<p>In the last book of the Pentateuch we meet with a verse
which, incidentally, seems to recognise how much more
vitally close and intimate may be the affinity between a man
and his bosom friend, than between the same man and his
own brother. The brother is spoken of without descriptive
epithet or adjunct of any kind; while of the friend it is added,
“which is as thine own soul.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> An ever memorable verse in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
the book of Proverbs has immortalized the truth, that “there
is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.”</p>

<p>None too many are the testimonies on record of brotherly
attachment such as Columbus signalizes in his correspondence.
To his elder son, Diego, the affectionate father writes concerning
the younger, Fernando, then a stripling midway in his
teens, “To thy brother conduct thyself as the elder brother
should unto the younger. Thou hast no other, and I praise
God that this is such a one as thou dost need. Ten brothers
would not be too many for thee. Never have I found a better
friend to right or left than my brothers.” General testimony
points the other way. Cicero, who, himself a good brother, in
one place moots the question whether it is just to prefer our
friends to our relations—<i>quæritur sitne æquum amicos cognatis
anteferre</i>,—in another decides that friendship is better than relationship:
<i>præstat amicitia propinquitati</i>. It has been remarked
by Samuel Bailey, of Sheffield, that parents and
children, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, reciprocally
complain of each other’s deficiency of affection, and think it
hard that the tie of relationship should not secure invariable
kindness and indestructible love: expecting some secret influence
of blood, some physical sympathy, some natural attraction, to
retain the affection of their relatives, without any solicitude on
their part to cherish or confirm it; and forgetting that man is
so constituted as to love only what in some way or other,
directly or indirectly, immediately or remotely, gives him
pleasure,—that even natural affection is the result of pleasurable
associations in his mind, or at least may be overcome by
associations of an opposite character, and that the sure way to
make themselves beloved is to display amiable qualities to
those whose regard they wish to obtain.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Crabbe has a terse

</div>

<p class="noindent">meaning by friends, kinsfolk; but such as, though not more than
kin, are less than kind. Dr. Croly’s hero, Marston, soldier and
statesman, on receiving, in his isolation, three letters from
three proved friends, yet comparative strangers, describes himself
as feeling, “while holding their letters in my hand, and
almost pressing them to my heart, how much more strongly
friendship may bind us than the ties of cold and negligent
relationship.” So Mr. Thackeray is bitter on what it is to
have sham friends and no sympathy; ties of kindred which
bind one, as it were, to the corpse of friendship, and oblige one
to bear through life the weight and the embraces of this lifeless,
cold connection.</p>

<p>Noteworthy among the avowals of Sir Thomas Browne, in
his “Religio Medici,” is this: “I confess I do not observe
that order that the schools ordain our affections,—to love our
parents, wives, children, and then our friends; for, excepting
the injunctions of religion, I do not find in myself such a necessary
and indissoluble sympathy to all those of my blood.
I hope I do not break the fifth commandment, if I conceive
I may love my friend before the nearest of my blood, even
those to whom I owe the principles of life.” The father and
the son may, as Montaigne says, be of quite contrary humours,
and brothers be without any sympathy with brothers. So
Feltham asserts it to be likeness which makes the true love-knot
of friendship. When we find another of our own disposition,
what is it, he asks, but the same soul in a divided body?
“We are then intermutually transposed into each other; and
nature, which makes us love ourselves, makes us for the same
reason love those who are like us; hence a friend is a more sacred
name than a brother.” What avails it, he further asks, to have
bodies of the same original, when the souls within them differ?</p>

<p>The autobiographer in a modern work of fiction, having
occasion to acknowledge, after being thrust amongst strangers
to sicken, and all but die, that among strangers he received as
much sympathy and kindness as he should have done among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
his own people, and in his father’s house,—characterizes this
sort of confession as one which people are apt to make as a
reflection upon their relations, “whereas it disgraces only themselves.”
It is a case of rare misfortune, he contends, when we
are not loved by our nearest of kin, in proportion as we desire
and deserve to excite affection. Nevertheless, there is a too
ample <i>consensus</i> of authorities whose testimony affirms, and
confirms, the often slight and slender tenure of mere family
ties, as such. “None of your family parties for me,” quoth
one of Justice Haliburton’s shrewd spokesmen; “connections
at best are poor friends, and commonly bitter enemies. If
you want nothing, go to them, and you are sure to get it; if
you are in want of any assistance, go to a stranger friend you
have <i>made for yourself</i>, and that’s the boy that has a heart and a
hand for you.” The Earl of Dudley, Bishop Copleston’s correspondent,
in one of his always interesting letters to that
prelate, adverting to the death of an uncle who had never
taken the smallest interest in him, or showed him the smallest
kindness, makes the avowal: “And, though I flatter myself
that there is no person more capable of returning affection than
myself, yet I fairly own that I am wholly unable to bestow it quite
gratuitously even upon a near relation.” Richardson harps
on this note again and again in his history of Clarissa. How
much more binding and tender, that young lady writes—and
the writing comes of bitter experience—are the ties of pure
friendship and the union of like minds, than the ties of
nature! And her chief correspondent, in commenting on
the terms of a kinsman’s assurance, that he will not see
Clarissa “imposed on either by friend or foe,”—interposes the
verbal amendment: “By <i>relation</i> or foe, should he not have
said? For a friend will not impose upon a friend.” Elsewhere
the same writer has to put the home-question: “Would you
side with a false brother against a true friend? A brother may
not be a friend; but a friend will be always a brother.”</p>

<p>It was one of the aphorisms—or call them paradoxes—of
M. de Stendhal (Henri Beyle) that our next of kin are our
natural enemies when we enter the world; the simple matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
of fact being, as an Edinburgh reviewer alleges, that his own
character, tendencies, and aspirations had been invariably opposed
to the plans, wishes, and modes of thinking of his
family. Mr. Froude has depicted in Edward Fowler a young
man who in his dealings with every one except with his own
family, was frank, generous, and unselfish; and whose affections,
naturally very strong, finding themselves forced out of their
proper channel, poured themselves out on any one that happened
to attract him. A few kind words from his father, now
and then, implying real sympathy and inviting confidence,
might, we are given to understand, have averted in this case,
as in so many others, a bitter result of estrangement and
desolation. Perhaps, as Mr. Disraeli somewhere intimates,
with all their anxiety and opportunities for observation, the
parent and tutor are rarely skilful in discovering the character
of their child or charge. “Custom blunts the fineness of psychological
study: those with whom we have lived long and
early, are apt to blend our essential and our accidental qualities
in one bewildering association.” Strange, exclaims Hamilton
Aïde, how little we often know of those who are next us in
the battle-ranks through this long march of life! Our daily
familiar life, as George Eliot has remarked, is but a hiding of
ourselves from each other behind a screen of trivial words and
deeds; and those who sit with us at the same hearth are often
the farthest off from the deep human soul within us, full of
unspoken evil and unacted good. “Strangers yet,” as Lord
Houghton has it:—</p>

<p>The rich man was getting richer to his heart’s content.
So plentiful was the produce of his land, that he must
needs enlarge his premises. There was not room enough in
his barns for those golden harvests; the barns must be pulled
down, and greater ones built, wherein to bestow all his fruits
and his goods. Happy man he accounted himself that day;
happy in a prosperous present, happier still in a promising
future. A future of happiness not less prolonged than assured.
So he would say to his soul that day, “Soul, thou hast much
goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and
be merry.” That day he said it. Fool! that night his soul
was required of him.</p>

<p>Woe was denounced by one of old on another of the Dives
family, who said, “I will build me a wide house, and large
chambers,” and who cut him out windows, and ceiled his house
with cedar, and painted it with vermilion. “Shalt thou reign
because thou closest thyself in cedar?” Man’s sanguine and
sure “I will”—how little of the future tense there sometimes
is about it after all!</p>

<p>The Turkish prince, Alp Arslan, dying of Joseph’s dagger-stroke,
bequeathed an admonition to the pride of kings, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
Gibbon has preserved. “Yesterday, as from an eminence I
beheld the numbers, the discipline, and the spirit of my
armies; the earth seemed to tremble under my feet; and I
said in my heart, ‘Surely thou art the king of the world, the
greatest and most invincible of warriors.’ These armies are
no longer mine; and in the confidence of my personal
strength, I now fall by the hand of an assassin.” The inscription
on his tomb invited those who had seen the glory of Alp
Arslan exalted to the heavens, to meditate on its present burial
in the dust.</p>

<p>Michelet moralises with trenchant irony on the fate which
overtook our Henry V. on French soil. It is to the “Dance
of Death” he refers in the exclamation, “What sport for
death, what a malicious pastime to have brought the victorious
Harry within a month’s reach of the crown of France! After
a life of unremitting toil for that end, he wanted but one little
month added to his existence to be the survivor of Charles VI....
No! not a month, not a day more was to be his.”</p>

<p>Splendid was that festival at Cæsarea at which Herod Agrippa,
in the pomp and pride of power, entered the theatre in a
robe of silver, which glittered, says the historian, with the
morning rays of the sun, so as to dazzle the eyes of the assembly,
and excite general admiration. Some of his flatterers set
up the shout, “A present god!” Agrippa did not repress the
impious adulation which spread through the theatre. At that
moment he looked up, and saw an owl perched over his head
on a rope, and Agrippa had been forewarned that when next
he saw that bird, “at the height of his fortune,” he would die
within five days. The fatal omen, according to Josephus,
pierced the heart of the king, who, with deep melancholy, exclaimed,
“Your god will soon suffer the common lot of mortality.”
He was immediately struck, in the language of the
sacred volume, by an angel. Seized with violent pains, he was
carried to his palace, lingered five days in extreme agony, being
“eaten of worms,” and so died.</p>

<p>Fielding forcibly presents a certain sanguine projector, lusty
and strong, in the heyday of middle age, who reckons confidently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
on becoming heir to the estate of a senior of immense
wealth, and has all his plans elaborately prepared for his disposal
of the same. Nothing is wanting to enable him to enter
upon the immediate execution of these plans, but the death of
the elder man, in calculating which he has studied every book
extant that treats of the value of lives, reversions, etc.; from
all which he has satisfied himself, that as he has every day a
chance of this happening, so has he more an even chance of
its happening before long. “But while the captain was one
day busied in deep contemplations of this kind, one of the
most unlucky, as well as most unseasonable, accidents happened
to him. The utmost malice of fortune could, indeed,
have contrived nothing so cruel, so <i>mal-à-propos</i>, so absolutely
destructive to all his schemes.” It was, that just at the very
instant when his heart was exulting in meditations on the
happiness which would accrue to him by the other’s death, he
himself was cut off by an apoplexy. As Léontine complains
in “Heraclius,”—</p>

<p>A tory historian, recording the close of the parliamentary
session in July 1827, takes occasion to observe that Mr.
Canning now saw every wish of his heart gratified, having
raised himself to the highest position in the State, and being
looked up to in every part of the world as the protector of the
oppressed and the advocate of freedom. In the prime of life,
“his sway in Parliament was unbounded, and he might hope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
for a long career of fame, fortune, and usefulness.” <i>Vanitas
vanitatum!</i> The hand of fate was already upon him, and he
was to be suddenly snatched from the scene of his glory, at the
very moment when he seemed to have attained the summit of
earthly felicity. Even, however, when death is not concerned,
as in his memorable case, in the sudden and final collapse of a
great career, and the abrupt extinction of exuberant promise,
how often is Cowper’s picture realized, where—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">“Runs the mountainous and craggy ridge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That tempts ambition. On the summit, see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The seals of office glitter in his eyes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He climbs, he pants, he grasps them. At his heels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Close at his heels, a demagogue ascends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with a dexterous jerk soon twists him down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wins them, but to lose them in his turn.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The picture is, in some sort, and for moral uses, a pendent
to that by another poet, of those who are pushing hard up hill
the cumbrous load of life; just as they trust to gain the farthest
steep, and put an end to strife,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Down thunders back the stone with mighty sweep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hurls their labours to the valley deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For ever vain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this is diverging farther and farther from the direct
import of our theme. More to the purpose is the same poet’s
description of Celadon assuring his betrothed of perfect safety,
and triumphantly asserting her absolute immunity from the
perils of the storm, and as exultingly inferring his own, from
his relationship to her; when,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">“From his void embrace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mysterious heaven! that moment to the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A blackened corse, was struck the beauteous maid.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some innocents, as Cleopatra has it, escape not the thunderbolt.
Innocence, as well as iniquity, may know something of
that breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose
breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.</p>

<p>The loving friends of Charlotte Brontè, after her marriage,
are described by one among them as catching occasional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
glimpses of brightness, and pleasant peaceful murmurs of
sound, telling to them who stood outside, of the gladness
within; and they said among themselves, “After a long and a
hard struggle—after many cares and bitter sorrows—she is
tasting happiness now.” Remembering her trials, they were
glad in the idea that God had seen fit to wipe away the tears
from her eyes. “But God’s ways are not as our ways,” Mrs.
Gaskell adds. Just as Currer Bell’s happiness seemed beginning,
and her goodness ripening, came fever, delirium, death.
Mrs. Gaskell’s own career was similarly cut short, just when she
was finishing, but ere yet she had finished, the completest and
ablest of her works; just when public recognition of her merits
was growing earnest as well as general. It is the old, old story.
For what, as the old ballad says,—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GREAT_BABYLON_BUILT_A_BUILDERS_BOAST"><i>GREAT BABYLON BUILT: A BUILDER’S BOAST.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> iv. 29-33.</p>

</div>

<p>Walking in the palace of his kingdom of Babylon—that
Babylon of which the foundations, indeed, had
been laid ages ago, but which he had so enlarged and adorned
as to make it one of the world’s wonders—Nebuchadnezzar the
king, elate with pride at the pomp of architectural results,
flushed with the triumph of enterprises so costly, and achievements
so manifest to the eye, gave utterance, in complacent
soliloquy perhaps, to the exultant sense of being a master
builder indeed, and of seeing his power reflected in so gorgeous
a form. The king spake and said, “Is not this great Babylon,
that I have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might
of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?”</p>

<p>While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
from heaven, saying, “O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is
spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee.” And the
sequel we know. How that same hour was the thing fulfilled
upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men, and did
eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of
heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his
nails like birds’ claws,—is it not written in the book of the
prophecies of Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, and whom
the king made ruler over the whole province of that same
Babylon the Great?</p>

<p>The royal builder’s boast was on the instant reproved by a
degradation literally brutal in its extremity. While the word
of complacent self-glorification was in the king’s mouth, the
sentence of bestial doom went forth against him. Just when
he was resting on his laurels, a taint overtook them. Just when
he rejoiced in asserting himself a king of kings, commenced
the working of a curse which levelled him with grazing flocks
and herds.</p>

<p>The lesson is for all time, and for all sorts and conditions of
men. Verifications of it—varying, of course, in kind, and still
more in degree—are rife in records historical and biographical,
and in the unrecorded experiences, the moving accidents, of
everyday life. Just when a man is apt to set up his rest, the
fiat goes forth against him which shatters to its base the structure
he has reared. The house he has just finished building
tumbles to pieces like a house of cards. The castle in whose
defences, at last completed, he felt so secure, dislimns like a
castle in the air.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">“... The engineer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who lays the last stone of his sea-built tower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It cost him years and years of toil to raise,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, smiling at it, tells the wind and waves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To roar and whistle now—but, in a night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beholds the tempest sporting in its place—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May look aghast.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
lords, and drank wine before the thousand, and displayed the
golden vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
of the temple at Jerusalem, and was jubilant with the excitement
of revelry, and joyously confident in the stability of his
realm; when, in the same hour, there came forth fingers of a
man’s hand, and wrote over against the plaster of the wall of
the king’s palace; and what they wrote was, that God had
numbered his kingdom, and finished it. And in that night
was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</p>

<p>A noble chamber had Pope John XXI. built for himself in
the palace of Viterbo; and by the falling in of the roof he
so admired, he was crushed to death. “John XXI.,” writes
Dean Milman, “was contemplating with too great pride the
work of his own hands, and burst out into laughter; at that
instant the avenging roof came down on his head.” The
catastrophe was held at the time to be a special judgment on
a reprobate pontiff. Nebuchadnezzar’s boast, and worse than
Nebuchadnezzar’s doom. The mention of Babylon the Great
will serve, with some, to eke out a parallel.</p>

<p>The historian of Mexico tells us of Montezuma, while exacting
from his people the homage of an adulation worthy of an
oriental despot, and the profuse expenditure of whose court was
a standing marvel, that “while the empire seemed towering in
its most palmy and prosperous state, the canker had eaten
deepest into its heart.” Ruin was at hand. The hour was
come, and the man; and that man was Hernando Cortès.</p>

<p>Significantly opens a fifth act—for a fifth act is the last—of
Ben Jonson’s “Sejanus,” with the joyous exultations of that
prosperous upstart, in the confidence of power: “Swell, swell,
my joys,” he exclaims,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">And, at each step, I feel my advanced head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knock out a star in heaven!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and so forth, with other hyperboles of frantic arrogance. His
soliloquy is interrupted by messengers of ill news. Destruction
dogs his path; and very soon the magniloquent braggart has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
to subdue his tone, and his cue is then to upbraid the higher
powers whom alone he recognises:—</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Of constant recurrence among the commonplaces of biography
are such “buts,” inopportune and inevitable, as Cicero’s
biographer prefixes to a critical paragraph: “But while all
things were proceeding very prosperously in his favour, and
nothing seemed wanting to crown his success, ... all his

<p>There is a popular historical fiction in which we see the
Cardinal Alberoni musing on the greatness he has achieved for
Spain and for himself, only to find himself overtaken by ruin
and disgrace. The rope which he has twisted so carefully,
proves to be of sand. In another we see a successful adventurer
at the culminating point of his success. There seems
nothing wanting to him in “that supreme moment,” as the
phrase goes. He is in “a tumult of gratified ambition and
selfish joy.” “This glory and grandeur” repay a thousand-fold
his patient endeavours and strenuous schemings. But at this
very moment a dark shadow overlays the sunshine on his pathway;
and we look on a changed countenance—“no longer
full of triumph and pleasure, but ghastly pale” at a sudden but
very present and very pressing sense of impending disaster.

<p>At the opening of the twelfth century all was prosperity with
the Emperor Henry IV.; his turbulent and agitated life seemed,
in the words of Dean Milman, “as if it would close in an
august and peaceful end.” But, as an after page in the history
of Latin Christianity is prompt to prove, this most secure and
splendid period in the life of Henry was one calm and brilliant
hour of evening before a night of utter gloom.</p>

<p>Columbus had just welcomed tranquillity in exchange for the
troubles and dangers of his island, when intelligence arrived of
the discovery of a large tract of country rich in mines. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
now anticipated the prosperous prosecution of his favourite
enterprise, and was exultant at the turn of the tide. “How
illusive were his hopes!” exclaims his biographer. “At this
moment events were maturing which were to overwhelm him
with distress, strip him of his honour, and render him comparatively
a wreck for the remainder of his days.” Who, the
chronicler of the conquest of Granada may well ask, who can
tell when to rejoice in this fluctuating world? “Every wave
of prosperity has its reacting surge, and we are often overwhelmed
by the very billow on which we thought to be wafted
into the haven of our hopes.” <i>Et subito casu, quæ valuere,
ruunt.</i></p>

<p>Such is the state of man, as Shakspeare’s Hastings feels it.
And this is the state of man, as Shakspeare’s Wolsey finds it:

he thinks, good easy man, full surely his goodness is a

<p>With the Red Sea close before them, and with Pharaoh
and his host close behind them, what were the children
of Israel to do? Was it for this that Moses had brought
them out of the house of bondage, which yet had its fleshpots
and creature comforts after all? What were they to do? They
lifted up their eyes, and saw the sea in front, and the enemy in
the rear; and then they lifted up their voice in querulous fear
and expostulation. Should they go back? Then Moses lifted
up his voice, and bade them stand still, and they should see a
great deliverance. But the will of God was not that they should
either go back, or stand still and merely look on. For “the
Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak
unto the children of Israel that they go forward.” Invocation
may be excellent in itself, but, as a concomitant, inaction mars
it. A hallowed thing is prayer; but to pray and sit still, when
the need is to go forward and push on, is the sign or stigma
of feeble folk.</p>

<p class="tb">When Nelson told the King of Naples, in plain terms, that
he had his choice—either to advance, trusting to God for His
blessing on a just cause, and prepared to die sword in hand;
or to remain quiet, and be kicked out of his kingdom; the king
made answer that he would go on, and trust in God and Nelson.
Of the same stuff as Nelson, but his superiors in moral
character and in practical recognition of Him that is Holy,
Holy, Holy, as well as Lord God Almighty, were those early
English navigators, characterized by a modern pen as “indomitable
God-fearing men, whose life was one great liturgy.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
“The ice was strong, but God was stronger,” says one of
Frobisher’s men, after grinding a night and a day among the
icebergs; not waiting for God to come down and split them,
but toiling through the long hours, himself and the rest fending
off the vessel with poles and planks, with death glaring at them
out of the rocks, and so saving themselves and it. We read in
Turell’s Life of Dr. Benjamin Colman, “that reverend father
in our New England Israel,” as Mr. Lowell calls him, that when
the vessel in which he had taken passage for England was
attacked by a French privateer, he “fought like a philosopher
and a Christian, ... and prayed all the while he charged
and fired.” His the practice was, if not on his lips the maxim,
to pray to God and keep his powder dry. It is expressly noted
of the Maid of Orleans, in the <i>Procès</i> on record, that while she
rather evaded the question of resorting to miraculous aids and
appliances, and of affecting supernatural power, she “used the
Gallic proverb, <i>Ayde-toi, Dieu te aydera</i>.”</p>

<p>Forcible is the portrait drawn in a recent work of fiction, of
a man now steeped in moral degradation, who had once tried
to be honest, and prayed to God to prosper his honesty; but
then he only tried to do right in a spasmodic, fitful kind of
way, and expected his prayers to be granted as soon as uttered,
and was indignant with a Providence that seemed regardless of
his entreaties.</p>

<p>Bentley is held to have happily ridiculed the helpless Chorus
of Greek tragedy, who, when a deed of violence was to be
acted, instead of interfering to prevent the atrocity to which the
perpetrator had made them privy, could only, by the rules of
the theatre, exhaust their sorrow and surprise in dithyrambics.
He burlesqued this characteristic by introducing into “The
Wishes” a Chorus after the manner of the ancient Greeks, who
are informed by one of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, that a madman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
with a firebrand has just entered the vaults beneath the place
which they occupy, and which contain a magazine of gunpowder.
The Chorus, instead of stirring from the dangerous vicinity,
immediately commence a long complaint of the hardship of
their fate, exclaiming pathetically, “O unhappy madman—or
rather unhappy we, the victims of this madman’s fury—or thrice,
thrice unhappy the friends of the madman, who did not secure
him, and restrain him from the perpetration of such deeds of
frenzy—or three and four times hapless the keeper of the
magazine, who forgot the keys in the door,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>The cry of Charles and his Paladins at Arles, “Help us,
oh blessed martyr St. Trophimus!” is thus disposed of by

worth a score of martyrs here,” in the thick of the fight for
dear life.</p>

<p>When Lord Rea, in 1630, as recorded in a well-known passage
from Rushworth, uttered the pious conventionalism or
devout platitude, “Well, God mend all!” his companion, Sir
David Ramsay, impatiently exclaimed, “Nay,” with an undevout
expletive, “Nay, Donald, we must help him to mend
it!” One is reminded of what Mr. Froude says of the
Protestant leaders in Scotland, during the autumn of 1559,
when the Queen Regent returned to Holyrood, once more
absolutely victorious: “Notwithstanding all their talk about
God, it had come to this. God had as much interest in them
as they had themselves courage, energy, capacity, understanding,
and perseverance—so much precisely, and not more.” Or
again of that homely thrust in the “Biglow Papers,” where one
of the interlocutors, on a critical occasion, avowing a wish to
know where and when to strike, is thus answered by his plain-spoken
mate:—</p>

<p>There is something to be said—indeed in our present sense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
there is more to be said, for the farmer than for the clergyman
in the story of the latter congratulating the former on
the state of his crops, and finding him not free from apprehensions,
in regard of former bad years—“My friend,” urged
the rector, “trust in Providence.” “Providence! Yes, yes,”
replied the other; “that’s all very well: but give me the
doong cart.” Dr. John Brown relates with zest how one of his
faculty was attending a poor woman in labour—a desperate
case, that required a cool head and a firm will, while the good
man, “for he <i>was</i> good,” had neither of these,—and losing his
presence of mind, gave up the poor woman as lost, and retired
into the next room to pray for her. “Another doctor, who
perhaps wanted what the first one had, and certainly had what he
wanted, brains and courage, meanwhile arrived, and called out,
‘Where is Dr. ⸺?’ ‘Oh, he has gone into the next room
to pray.’ ‘Pray! Tell him to come here this instant, and help
me; he can work and pray too;’” and by the new-comer’s, the
<i>snell</i> working doctor’s, assistance the woman’s life was saved.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel, in his reply to certain suggestions offered by
Lord Kenyon in reference to the potato-disease, coupled with
the recommendation of a “special public acknowledgment of
our dependence on God’s mercy in our present distressed state,”

such an acknowledgment, while at the same time leaving “in
full operation the restraints which man has imposed on the import
of provisions.”</p>

<p>Not likely to be soon forgotten, on either side the Tweed, is

cleanse than to fast. Let them see to purifying the foul wynds
and overcrowded flats tenanted by the poor, and so get rid of
“those causes and sources of contagion which, if allowed to
remain, will infallibly breed pestilence, and be fruitful in death,
in spite of all the prayers and fastings of a united, but inactive
nation.” To apply what a north country bishop says in

<p>A recent apologist for the captain of a lost steamship submitted
that the destruction of that fine vessel was what is called
in the old-fashioned language of a charter-party, “the act of
God.” Less partial critics, on the other hand, affirmed it to be
the act of the folly and madness of man,—the term quoted belonging
to an age when they who go down to the sea in ships
had not learned the irreverent practice of imputing to the Deity
the direct consequences of human rashness. “Let us, if we
can, amend this folly; or, if we will persist in it, let us at least
take the blame upon ourselves.” They that go down to the
sea in ships have, however, in all ages, though not so much one
people as another (English for instance as Italians), been
prone to waste in wailing outcries to patron saints the energy
that, in peril of wreck, they might have expended to better
purpose. The “Colloquies” of Erasmus give a lively sample of
this run-to-waste invocation. The last of the heroes of La
Vendée, Charette, while still a youth, sailed from Brest in a
cutter which lost its mast, and was in imminent jeopardy of
going down; the sailors, on their knees, were praying to the
Virgin, and had entirely given up all notion of exertion, “till
Charette, by killing one, succeeded in bringing the others to a
sense of their duty, and thereby saved the vessel.” Lord
Broughton describes a scene of the kind, in a Turkish ship of
war: the Greeks on board called on all the saints, the Mussulmans
on Allah; the captain burst into tears and ran below
deck, telling his passengers to call on God: he rung his hands,
and wept aloud, and being asked what he could do, said he
could do nothing. “Could he get back to the main land?”
“If God chooses,” was his answer. “Could he make Corfu?”
“If God chooses.” One thinks of the testy old patrician’s rejoinder
in “Coriolanus” to the tribune’s exclaimer, “The gods be
good unto us!” “No; in such a case the gods will not be
good unto us.” In Scott’s tale of the Crusaders, “I will vow a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
golden candlestick to the Holy Sepulchre—a shrine of silver to
our Lady of Engaddi—a pall, worth one hundred bezants to
Saint Thomas of Orthez,” cries the Queen in extremity.—“Up,
up, madam,” says Edith; “call on the saints an you list, but
be your own best saint.” In “Ivanhoe,” again, when the Grand
Master forbodes the contingent extinction of his order (the
Templars), “Now may God avert such a calamity!” says the
Preceptor. “Amen!” rejoins the Grand Master, with
solemnity, “but we must deserve His aid.”</p>

<p>It is all in keeping with the practical character of the man,
the prayer which on one critical occasion Benvenuto Cellini
records his offering: “Almighty God, favour my cause, for
Thou knowest it is a just one, and that I am not on my part
wanting in my utmost efforts to make it succeed.” On another
he tells us how he “told Lionardo, who was incessantly crying
out, ‘Jesus, Jesus!’ that Jesus would assist him, if he strove
to help himself.” Elsewhere again Cellini emphatically asserts
his systematic habit of “always exerting his utmost efforts to
extricate” himself from difficulty, as well as of devoutly recommending
himself to God, by whom alone those efforts could
achieve success, and who so often had delivered him when the
best of these had clearly and entirely failed.</p>

<p>Saintly as well as Saint Francis of Sales bids his brethren,
“En toutes vos affaires, appuyez-vous totalement sur la providence
de Dieu, par laquelle seule tous vos desseins doivent
réussir; travaillez néanmoins de votre côté tout doucement
pour co-opérer avec icelle.” The counsel is at one, <i>au fond</i>,
with that of the heathen stoic in the old play:—</p>

<p>As the author of “Felix Holt” says, we see human heroism
broken into units, and are apt to imagine, this unit did little—might
as well not have been. But in this way we might break
up a great army into units; in this way we might break the
sunlight into fragments, and think that this and the other
might be cheaply parted with. “Let us rather raise a monument
to the soldiers whose brave hearts only kept the ranks
unbroken, and met death—a monument to the faithful who
were not famous, and who are precious as the continuity of the
sunbeams is precious, though some of them fall unseen and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
barrenness.” Suppose but a solution of that continuity; the
sequel is, darkness that may be felt.</p>

<p>There is a latter-day apologue of a gimlet that grew exceedingly
discontented with its vocation, envying all the other tools
in the carpenter’s basket, and thinking scorn of its own mean
duty of perpetually boring and picking holes everywhere.
“The saw and the axe had grand work to do; and the plane
got praise always; so did the chisel for its carving; and the
happy hammer was always ringing merrily upon the clenching
nail.” But for <i>it</i>, a wretched, poking, paltry, gimlet, its work
was hidden away, and very little seemed its recognised use.
But the gimlet is assured, on the best authority, that nothing
could compensate for its absence, and is therefore bidden be
content, nay happy; for though its work seems mean and
secret, it is indispensable. To its good offices, the workman is
said to look chiefly for coherence without splitting; and to its
quiet influences, the neatness, the solidity, the comfort of his
structure may greatly be ascribed. The apologue has, of
course, its practical application. “Are there not many pining
gimlets in society, ambitious of the honour given to the
greater-seeming tools of our Architect, but unconscious that in
His hands they are quite as useful? The loving little child,
the gentle woman, the patience of many a moral martyr, the
diligence of many a duteous drudge, though their works may
be unseen and their virtues operate in obscurity, yet are these
main helpers to the very joints and bands of our body corporate,
the quiet home influences whereby the great edifice,
Society, is so nicely wainscoted and floored without split-boards.”</p>

<p>To recognise one’s being entrusted with but one talent, after
all, and not with five or with ten, as one’s vanity had previously
taken for granted, has even been hailed as, in some
sort, a soothing sensation. When one of us who has been led
by native vanity or senseless flattery, says Dr. Holmes, to
think himself or herself possessed of talent, arrives at the full
and final conclusion that he or she is really dull, it is one of
the most tranquillizing and blessed convictions that can enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
a mortal’s mind: “All our failures, our short-comings, our
strange disappointments in the effect of our efforts, are lifted
from our bruised shoulders, and fall, like Christian’s pack, at
the feet of that Omnipotence which has seen fit to deny us the
pleasant gifts of high intelligence,—with which one look may
overflow us in some wider sphere of being.” That the one
talent be employed, is the one thing needful. So feels the girl
in one of Charlotte Brontè’s tales, whose exclamation is,
“Mother, the Lord who gave each of us our talents will come
home some day, and will demand from all an account. The
tea-pot, the old stocking-foot, the linen rag, the willow-pattern
tureen, will yield up their barren deposit in many a house:
suffer your daughters, at least, to put their money to the
exchangers, that they may be enabled at the Master’s coming
to pay His own with usury.” A man is accepted according to
that he hath, not condemned in respect of what he never had.
Whatsoever his hand findeth to do, that is what a man is to do
with his might, to do with a will,—be it to govern a nation,
or to dust a warehouse. To apply a passage in Ben Jonson’s
“Catiline,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They are no less part of the commonwealth</div>

<p class="noindent">John Newton said that if two angels came down from heaven to
execute a Divine command, and one was appointed to conduct
an empire, and the other to sweep a street in it, they would
feel no inclination to change employments. So again, the
same robust divine affirmed that a Christian should never
plead spirituality for being a sloven; “if he be but a shoe-cleaner,
he should be the best in the parish.” As the old
servant tells Ruth, in Mrs. Gaskell’s story, “There’s a right
and a wrong way of setting about everything—and to my
thinking, the right way is to take a thing up heartily, if it is
only making a bed. Why, dear ah me! making a bed may be
done after a Christian fashion, I take it, or else what’s to
come of such as me in heaven, who’ve had little enough time
on earth for clapping ourselves down on our knees for set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
prayers?” This quaint speaker had laid to heart the lesson
once for all enforced upon her, to do her duty in that state of
life to which it had pleased God to call her; her station was
that of a servant, and, looked at aright, as honourable as a
king’s: she was to help and serve others in one way, just as a
king is in another. Her parting counsel to Ruth runs thus:
“Just try for a day to think of all the odd jobs as to be done
well and truly in God’s sight, not just slurred over any how,
and you’ll go through them twice as cheerfully,” besides doing
them more efficiently. John Brown, of Haddington, being
waited on by a lad of excitable temperament, who informed
him of his desire to become a preacher, and whom the shrewd
pastor saw to be as weak in intellect as he was strong in
conceit, advised him to continue in his present vocation. The
young man said, “But I wish to preach and glorify God.”
The old commentator replied, “My young friend, a man may
glorify God making broom besoms; stick to your trade, and
glorify God by your life and conversation.” As it was said of
Bossuet, in the seventeenth century, that he could not walk, or
sit down, or even pluck a currant, without your recognising
in him the great bishop (so asserts a modern French divine,
not of Bossuet’s church), just so the workman and the domestic
servant who are animated by their Master’s spirit, distinguish
themselves among their fellows by a certain air of nobility;
under their blouse or their livery may be seen to shine the
signal light of their <i>aristocratie spirituelle</i>, the image of the Most
High Himself. However mean their employment, they go
about it with neither disgust nor indifference; but with an
intelligent interest, because, in the sight of God, and indeed in
their own eyes, their occupation is on a level with that of
king or emperor. What constitutes the difference between
man and man, is not, urges M. Colani, the wielding a
sceptre or plying a needle, but the being loyal to the trust, be
it great or small, committed to us. This, he contends, is the
only true point of view from which men and women should
regard their occupations,—they should consider themselves as
<i>collaborateurs du Tout-Puissant</i>. If their work seem the reverse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
of noble, let them ennoble it by this thought, in Wordsworth’s
phrase,—</p>

<p class="noindent">A Christian nursemaid is pictured, forgetting the thousand
<i>désagréments</i> of her humble functions, and reminding herself
that in reality she is in charge of souls, as much as pastor or
preacher is, and this <i>grande conviction</i> suffices to save her from
servile dejection. So, again, the artisan and day labourer may
be sustained by the Spirit from on high, and taught to magnify
their calling, in a deep and a wide sense, because it is what they
are called to, and because they respond to the call, in the spirit
of it. They are toilers co-operant to an end; and the end, the
result, is with God. “They also serve who only stand and
wait.” But the whole sonnet of Milton’s which closes with
that grand line, is too germane to the matter, and too largely
suggestive in its main issue, to be omitted here; the sonnet
which the blind poet wrote touching his blindness:—</p>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">1 Corinthians</span> xii. 22.</p>

</div>

<p>Strenuously St. Paul insists on the importance of
not overlooking the feebler members of the body—be
it physical, politic, or ecclesiastical,—and of upholding their
rights to due consideration, on the mere score of membership.
Subordinate they may be, but superfluous they are not. The
body would not be a body without them. “Nay, much more,
those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble,
are necessary.” “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members
in particular.” If all were one member, where were the body?
But now are they many members, but one body. And one
member differeth from another in honour; yet, without the
seeming minor and meaner ones, for all the abundant honour
of the greater ones, where were the body?</p>

<p class="tb">Human society, it has been said, is a vast and intricate
machine, composed of innumerable wheels and pulleys:—every
one has his special handle to grind at; some with great and
obvious effects, others with little or no assignable result; but if
the object ultimately produced by the combined efforts of all
is in itself a good one, it is not to be denied that whatever is
essential to its production is good also. Human society is
thus regarded as a body corporate, made up of different members,
each of which has its own special function: one class
tilling the ground, another combining and distributing its produce,
a third making, and a fourth executing laws, and so on,
through every class of society. “If all these functions are
properly discharged, the whole body corporate is in a healthy
condition; and thence it follows that whoever contributes to
the full and proper discharge of any one of these functions, is
contributing to the general good of the whole body; so that a
person occupied in them is doing good in the strictest sense
of the words.” An able discourser on social subjects, arguing
against a current crotchet, utterly denies that a girl in a respectable
family does not earn the honourable title of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
worker, though she be only employed in assisting in house-keeping
and at the family work-table, just as fairly and as completely
as if she walked to a solicitor’s office for an eight hours’
daily task of copying briefs and making out bills of costs.</p>

<p>Frederick Robertson glowingly expatiates on the glory of
womanhood, as surely one which, if woman rightly comprehended
her place on earth, might enable her to accept its
apparent humiliation unrepiningly; the glory, as he defines it,
of unsensualizing coarse and common things, sensual things,
the objects of mere sense, meat and drink and household cares,
elevating them by the spirit in which she ministers them, into
something transfigured and sublime. “The humblest mother
of a poor family, who is cumbered with much serving, or
watching over a hospitality which she is too poor to delegate
to others, or toiling for love’s sake in household work, needs
no emancipation in God’s sight. It is the prerogative and the
glory of her womanhood to consecrate the meanest things by a
ministry which is not for self.” What hundreds and thousands
of female invalids have felt, and almost in the same words said,
with Lucy Aikin, when enfeebled with age and other ailments,
“The thought which sits heavy on my mind is that of my own
inutility. Alas! what important end of existence do I fulfil?
To whom is it of any real consequence whether or not I continue
to fill a place in the world? I hope that involuntary
uselessness will not be imputed, and that we may say, ‘They
also serve who only stand and wait.’” A fellow-worker of the
same sex, but made of sterner stuff, in the dedication of a book
written in illness, tells her friend, “You know, as well as I,
how withering would be the sense of our own nothingness, if
we tried to take comfort from our own dignity and usefulness.”
And she goes on to say how ridiculous, if it were not shocking,
would be any complacency on the ground of having followed
the instincts of her nature to work, while work was possible,—the
issues of such divinely appointed instrumentality being
wholly brought out and directed by Him who framed and
actuated her. To apply the words of Aurora Leigh:—</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All service ranks the same with God:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Are we; there is no last nor first.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Wordsworth is eloquently suggestive in those prefatory lines
of his, which weave a moral and infer a solace, from the fact,
that the stars pre-eminent in magnitude, and they that from
the zenith dart their beams, are yet of no diviner origin, no
purer essence, than the one he watched from Rydal Mount,
burning like an untended watch-fire on the ridge of some dark
hill-top; or than those which seem</p>

<p class="noindent">If we weave a yard of tape in all humility, says Emerson, and
as well as we can, long hereafter we shall see that it was “no
cotton tape at all, but some galaxy which we braided, and that
the threads were Time and Nature.” Without number, as Archdeacon
Hare puts it, are the sutlers and pioneers, the engineers
and artisans, who attend the march of intellect; many of
them busied in building and fitting up and painting and emblazoning
the chariot; others in lessening the friction of the wheels;
while others move forward in detachments, and level the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
it is to pass over, and cut down the obstacles which would
impede its progress. And these too, he proceeds to say, “have
their reward. If so be they labour diligently in their calling,
not only will they enjoy that calm contentment which diligence
in the lowliest task never fails to win; not only will the sweat
of their brows be sweet, and the sweetener of the rest that
follows; but, when the victory is at last achieved, they come
in for a share of the glory; even as the meanest soldier who
fought at Marathon or at Leipsic became a sharer in the glory
of those saving days.” Remember, with Owen Meredith,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Remember, every man God made</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is different: has some deed to do,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Though thine be humble: do it too.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An elder teacher would qualify the Remember by a Do not
forget, that “it matters infinitely less what we <i>do</i> than what
we <i>are</i>.” If we cannot pursue a trade or a science—says a memorable
voice from a sick-room,—if we cannot keep house, or
help the state, or write books, or earn our own bread or that of
others, we can do the work to which all this is only subsidiary;
“we can cherish a sweet and holy temper; we can vindicate
the supremacy of mind over body; we can, in defiance of our
liabilities, minister pleasure and hope to the gayest who come
prepared to receive pain from the spectacle of our pain; we
can, here as well as in heaven’s courts hereafter, reveal the
angel growing into its immortal aspect, which is the highest
achievement we could propose to ourselves, or that grace from
above, could propose to us, if we had a free choice of all possible
conditions of human life.”</p>

<p>To all those possible conditions, so manifold in their potentialities,
the doctrine applies. The membership is a constant
quantity. <i>Nil me officit unquam</i>, says Horace, <i>Ditior hic,
aut est quia doctior; est locus uni Cuique suus</i>. And we have
Shakspeare’s word for it, that nought so vile upon the earth
doth live, but to the earth some special good doth give; and
though he is speaking of stones and the like, are there not
sermons in stones, as well as good in everything?</p>

<p>Holy George Herbert shall furnish us with a versicle to the

<p class="noindent">But more pertinent, and less quaintly obscure, is that stanza

exalts the exalting power of a simple trust in God and devotion
to His service:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WRATH-DISPELLING_POWER_OF_A_SOFT_ANSWER"><i>THE WRATH-DISPELLING POWER OF A SOFT ANSWER.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> xv. 1.</p>

</div>

<p>While it is the effect, if not the end and aim, of
grievous words to stir up anger,—“a soft answer turneth
away wrath.” Though “the wrath of a king is as messengers
of death, a wise man will pacify it.” “By long forbearing is
a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.”</p>

<p>When the men of Ephraim, enraged at Gideon’s failing to
invoke their aid when he went to fight with the Midianites,
chided with him sharply, his soft answer was of instant avail
to turn away their wrath. What had he done now in comparison
of them? the champion deferentially exclaimed; and
what was he able to do in comparison of them? Was not the
mere gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the entire
vintage of Abi-ezer? “Then their anger was abated toward
him, when he had said that.” What threatened to be a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
bone of contention,—well, so soft a tongue as that of Jerubbaal,
who is Gideon, breaketh the bone.</p>

<p>Discussing Lord Aberdeen’s settlement of the vexed question
of the right of search, in 1843, the historian of Europe observes
that never was there a truer maxim than that it requires the
consent of two persons to make a quarrel; a soft word, a
seasonable explanation, often turns aside wrath, and sometimes
prevents the most serious wars that threaten to devastate the
world. Æsop Smith says he never knew a downright quarrel
yet, where two people were not in the wrong; “drop your
battledore, and the shuttlecock will fall. ‘A soft answer turneth
away wrath.’ No doubt it does, in nine cases out of ten,”—but
not quite always, this authority affirms; there being some
unreasonable quarrellers, who will batter the peacemaker when
he drops his battledore. But as a rule, and on the authority
of an older and still more widely recognised maker of proverbs,
the mere fact of yielding pacifieth great offences.</p>

<p>The historian of the conquest of Peru tells us how Gasca
was assailed by reproaches and invectives which, however, had
no power to disturb his equanimity; he patiently listened, and
replied to all in the mild tone of expostulation best calculated
to turn away wrath. “By this victory over himself,” says
Garcilasso, “he acquired more real glory, than by all his
victories over his foes.” As Spenser has it,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“Words well-disposed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have secret power t’ appease inflamèd rage.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sir Matthew Hale’s celebrated letter of advice includes this
counsel,—if a person be passionate, and give you ill language,
rather to pity him than be moved to anger. We shall find, the
pious judge asserts, that silence, or very gentle words, are the
most exquisite revenge for reproaches; they will either cure
the distemper in the angry man, and make him sorry for his
passion, or they will be a severe reproof and punishment to
him. “But at any rate,” adds Sir Matthew, “they will preserve
your innocence, give you the deserved reputation of wisdom
and moderation, and keep up the serenity and composure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
of your mind. Passion and anger make a man unfit for
everything that becomes him as a man or as a Christian.”</p>

<p>The fact is, maintains the author of “The Gentle Life,” all
hard words are a mistake: most of our quarrels arise from a
total misunderstanding of each other; and at any rate, hard
words will not mend the matter. One might as well, he says,
try to mend glass windows by pelting them with stones. Soft
words, on the other hand, fall like a healing balm on the hearts
of all. “Such power,” in the words of one who loved to be
written, if not to write himself, Leontius, “such power has the
least shadow of a pleasant speech, to do away an ill-feeling of
the moment, in the complacency it produces, both in the giver
and receiver.” To apply, again, a passage from Spenser,
descriptive of a damsel’s success in deterring two doughty
knights from mortal encounter, so effective was her speech to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">... “calm the sea of their tempestuous spite:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such power have pleasing words! Such is the might</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of courteous clemency in gentle heart!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are all of us fond of gentle words, once more to
quote an <i>ex titulo</i> authority on all that concerns gentle living;
and he denies the truth of the common rough proverb,
“Soft words butter no parsnips,” which is shown to be,
after all, an apologetic proverb, meaning that the hearer is
tickled with the politeness, albeit real satisfaction is not yet
made. “Soft words do butter parsnips; and many an oily
fellow, whose talent, industry, and conscientiousness are small,
owes his position and advancement in life to the soft words
which drop continually from his mouth.” The soft answer that
avails to dispel wrath, comes of practised patience; and when
patience has its perfect work, it works miracles, as detailed by
that fine old forgotten poet, Decker:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It is the greatest enemy to law</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That can be, for it doth embrace all wrongs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so chains up lawyers and women’s tongues;</div>
    <div class="center">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And last of all, to end a household strife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is the honey ’gainst a waspish wife.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span></p>

<p>This reminds us of a passage in “The Gordian Knot,” where
the gentle laying of a husband’s hand in an irritated wife’s,
or <i>vice versâ</i>, is recommended (by example) as a good plan
to adopt in conjugal discussions when differences arise. The
tongue, says our author, is very proud, abominably proud and
sulky, and often refuses to say what the heart desires should be
said; but the fingers know their duty, and are ready to convey
an apologetic or forgiving pressure, which, he makes bold to
assert, “will stop ninety-nine quarrels out of a hundred, if the
parties love one another.”</p>

<p>The greatest, widest, deepest of all observers of human
nature puts into the mouth of one of the sagest of kings this
counsel to a younger son, in respect to his bearing towards the
elder:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">... “Blunt not his love; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he is gracious, if he be observed;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">As humorous as winter, and as sudden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As flaws<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> congealed in the spring of day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His temper, therefore, must be well observed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But being moody, give him line and scope;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In a later one, again, of his noble series of English history

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_TWICE-TOLD_TALE_OF_YEARS"><i>A TWICE-TOLD TALE OF YEARS.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Ecclesiastes</span> vi. 6.</p>

</div>

<p>The preacher, whose text was Vanity of vanities, all is
vanity, pictures in one section of his homily a man who
has lived many years, “so that the days of his years be many,”
but whose soul is not filled with good, but aches rather with
a gnawing sense of emptiness, so that his many years, gloomy
as they have been, are all too few. “Yea, though he live a
thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not
all go to one place?” What more tedious than such a twice-told
tale of years? Yet, to look back upon, how fleet their
transit, how imperceptible their lapse, how petty the sum of
them! That tale is soon told, even if told twice.</p>

<p>The days of our life are threescore years and ten, and
though men be so strong that they come to fourscore years,
yet is their strength then but labour and sorrow; nor do the
fourscore seem longer to the retrospective reviewer than
do to the sexagenarian his sixty years, or to the septuagenarian
his threescore and ten. The most popular of
contemporary authors describes a man of seventy-eight, of
whom a loveless, sad-hearted questioner asks whether his
seventy-eight years would not be seventy-eight heavy curses, if
he could say to himself, as the questioner can, “I have secured
to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of
no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered
by.” The Royal Preacher would apply context as
well as text to such a retrospect, with an “I say, that an untimely
birth is better than he. For he cometh in with vanity,
and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with
darkness. Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known
anything: this hath more rest than the other. Yea, though he
live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good.”</p>

<p>The same questioner, already cited, asks the same old man
if his childhood seems far off,—if the days when he sat at
his mother’s knee seem days of very long ago? To which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
the experience of threescore and eighteen years gives this
reply: “Twenty years back, yes: at this time of my life, no.
For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the
circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning.” But he is not one
to feel and say with the French cynic, “Mais enfin la vie se
passe, et mourir après s’être amusé ou s’être ennuyé dix ou
vingt ans, c’est la même chose.” He has not so learned life,
and the meaning of life, and its purpose, and its end.</p>

<p>Infinite is the swiftness of time, says Seneca, as seen by
those who are looking back at time past. <i>Infinita est velocitas
temporis, quæ magis apparet respicientibus.</i> Looked forward to,
it is another matter altogether. As Cowper has it, when retracing
the windings of his way through many years,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Short as in retrospect the journey seems,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It seemed not always short; the rugged path,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moved many a sigh at its disheartening length.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But as Cowper elsewhere draws the contrast, in the Latin
motto he wrote for the king’s clock,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Quæ lenta accedit, quam velox præterit hora!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(Slow comes the hour; its passing speed how great!—so
Hayley Englished the line.) “Since this new epoch in my
life,” writes Schleiermacher on a certain occasion, “time seems
to fly twice as quickly as before, and I can quite fancy that
when Jatte and I are grown old and grey, we shall still feel as
if only a few days had gone by.” Moore was in his sixtieth
year when Lord John Russell talked with him of the speed
with which time seems to fly; and Moore records in his Diary
the question he put, “If you find it so now, what will you say
of it when you are as old as I am?” The “peculiar melancholy”
of the answer given is emphasised in the same journal.</p>

<p>Another retrospective reviewer pictures our race as struggling
ever onward, toiling up towards some air-built goal never
to be attained—while the past crumbles instantly away behind
our steps, like the staircase of the Epicurean, as we advance
in our progress; and every step, which was of such magnitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
when we passed it, is forgotten in the “collectiveness of retrospection,”
insomuch that at times a passing thought would
compass the events of years.</p>

<p>Few and evil the patriarch declares the days of the years
of his pilgrimage to have been, when, in answer to Pharaoh’s
“How old art thou?” the answer is, A hundred and thirty
years. Man that is born of a woman is of few days, said
another patriarch, and full of trouble. His days are swifter
than a post, they flee away, they see no good. They are
passed away as the swift ships; they are swifter than a weaver’s
shuttle. <i>Festinat enim decurrere velox Flosculus angustæ miseræque
brevissima vitæ Portio.</i> And thus in Juvenal’s pregnant
phrase, <i>obrepit non intellecta senectus</i>. Or, as with the ageing
subject of the Three Warnings,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Time whose haste no mortal spares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uncalled, unheeded, unawares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought him on his eightieth year.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.</p>

<p>In one of his letters to his old friend Mrs. Hughes, Southey
commences a paragraph with the truism, “The last twenty
years, to you and me, are but as yesterday;” and he adds, that
if we could but bring ourselves to feel, as truly as we know,
that the next twenty years are but as to-morrow, that feeling,
with a trust in God’s mercy, would be sufficient consolation
under all sorrows. Half a year later we find him writing to
her in the same strain: “It seems but as yesterday when I
look back twenty, thirty, forty, and even more years; the end,
therefore, of my mortal term would seem but as to-morrow if
it were rightly looked on to. A little while, and we shall be
young again, beyond all power of time and change, with those
whom we love, and to continue with them for ever and ever.”
Madame de Sévigné utters her pure French hélas! over the
like retrospect of twenty years: “Hélas! est-il possible qu’il y
ait vingt-un ans? il me esembleque ce fut l’année passée; mais
je juge, par le peu que m’a duré ce temps, ce que me paraîtront
les années qui viendront encore.” Home, straight home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
to every heart comes the homely moral of the bard addressing
the busy, curious, thirsty fly he freely welcomed to his cup, and
whose little life he compared with his longer yet little own:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Both alike are mine and thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hastening quick to their decline:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine’s a summer, mine no more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though repeated to threescore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Threescore summers, when they’re gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will appear as short as one.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If for threescore we read fourscore, it would not mar the
metre, or the rhyme or reason.</p>

<p>Man is never so deluded as when he dreams of his own
duration, says Cowper; and he goes on to cite Jacob’s retrospective
reviewal of years elapsed: “The answer of the old
patriarch to Pharaoh may be adapted by every man at the close
of the longest life. ‘Few and evil have been the days of the
years of my pilgrimage.’ Whether we look back from fifty or
from twice fifty, the past equally appears a dream; and we
can only be said truly to have lived while we have been profitably
employed.” And as the sovereign lady of French letter-writers
has her Hélas! so one of the princes among English
letter-writers has his Alas! to utter on this trite topic, “Alas,
then, making the necessary deductions, how short is life!”
Though the life be made up of a thousand years twice told,
the tale is told so soon, and the teller seems to himself but as
a dreamer, and his little life is rounded with a sleep; like as a
dream when one awaketh.</p>

<p>The good emperor Marcus Antoninus, one of those whom a
broad churchmanship is free and fain to recognise as Seekers
after God, is taken to intimate that the difference between a so-called
long and a short life is insignificant, in regard of Eternity,
when he indites this aphorism, among his Meditations: “When
frankincense is thrown upon the altar, one grain usually falls
before another; but then the distance of time is of no
moment.” The moments, so to speak, of difference, are not
momentous. Do not all go to one place?</p>

<p>But in the issue, all depends on the using. Happy the few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
and evil years of a patriarch, if a patriarch indeed, of a pilgrim
going home. Be they few and evil in one sense, or in
another very many,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DAYBREAK_NO_SOLACE_NIGHTFALL_NO_RELIEF">DAYBREAK NO SOLACE: NIGHTFALL NO RELIEF.</h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Deuteronomy</span> xxviii. 36, 37.</p>

</div>

<p>Not the least impressive of the afflictions denounced
against a disloyal people, in the book Deuteronomy, is
that which should make day and night a fear and a trouble to
them; so that in the morning they should say, “Would God
it were even!” and at even, “Would God it were morning!”
There is at once terrible realism and suggestiveness in words
but too familiar to most who have themselves suffered, or
watched by the couch of sleepless suffering. Job utters a
complaint of wearisome nights as appointed to him; so that
when he lay down, he said, “When shall I arise, and the night
be gone?” and thus was he full of tossings to and fro unto the
dawning of the day. Like the Psalmist, he cried in the daytime,
but it seemed that God heard not; and in the night
season he was not silent, but it seemed as though from above
there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
In such cases, one day telleth another of seeming
desolation; and one night certifieth another almost of despair.
And the eventide is longed for in broad daylight, if haply, with
mere change, it may bring relief. But when it has set in, and
eve has saddened into night, there is wearying for daybreak, as
possibly the bringer of a boon that, however, it fails to bring.</p>

<p>A stanza in one of Shakspeare’s poems contains an example
to the purpose:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And time doth weary time with her complaining:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And both she thinks too long with her remaining:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Short time seems long in sorrow’s sharp sustaining.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they that watch, see time how slow it creeps.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And thus runs one of Landor’s imitations from the Greek, of
an address to Hesperus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have beheld thee in the morning hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A solitary star, with thankless eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ungrateful as I am! who bade thee rise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When sleep all night had wandered from my bower.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One of, and not the least fearful of, the curses denounced
against Byron’s Manfred is, that to him shall Night deny all the
quiet of her sky; and the day shall have a sun which shall
make him wish it done. Crabbe’s Tale of Edward Shore has
to tell how, at one stage of that sombre career,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Struck by new terrors, from his friends he fled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wept his woes upon a restless bed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Retiring late, at early hour to rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With shrunken features, and with bloodshot eyes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If sleep one moment closed the dismal view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fancy her terrors built upon the true;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And night and day had their alternate woes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That baffled pleasure, and that mocked repose.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The hero of one popular prose fiction describes himself as
lying awake night after night, quivering with his great sorrow—wishing
that the first dull grey of morning would appear at the
window; and when it came, longing for night and darkness
once more. Of the heroine in another we read that “the
terrible ‘demon of the bed,’ that invests our lightest sorrows
with such hopeless and crushing anxiety, reigned triumphant
over its gentle victim; and yet, when the daylight crept
through her uncurtained windows, she shrunk from it, as though
in her broken spirit she preferred to hide her distress in the
gloom of night, fearful and unrelieved as was its dark dominion.”
How sickening, how dark, exclaims Keats, in the fantastic
diction of “Endymion,” “the dreadful leisure of weary days,
made deeper exquisite by a foreknowledge of unslumbrous
night!” Mr. Tennyson pictures to us the simple maid Elaine,
who went half the night repeating, Must she die?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And now to right she turned, and now to left,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And found no ease in turning or in rest”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">like one of those depicted by Keble—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“... who darkling and alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would wish the weary night were gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though dawning morn should only show</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The secret of their unknown woe.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Shelley sings of the desire “of the night for the morrow” when
expressing the devotion to something afar from the sphere of
our sorrow. Gray vividly depicts the state of mind of one
who—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... starts from short slumbers, and wishes for morning—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To close his dull eyes when he sees it returning.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Of Mrs. Gaskell’s Jemima we read, that “the night, the sleepless
night, was so crowded and haunted by miserable images,
that she longed for day; and when day came, with its stinging
realities, she wearied and grew sick for the solitude of night.”
So with Shenstone’s Jessie:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Amid the dreary gloom of night I cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When will the morn’s once pleasing scenes return?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet what can morn’s returning ray supply,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But foes that triumph, or but friends that mourn?”</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BUYERS_BARGAIN_AND_BOAST"><i>BUYER’S BARGAIN AND BOAST.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Proverbs</span> xx. 14.</p>

</div>

<p>Considering what goes to make up a proverb, it would
be strange if, in the book of Proverbs, part though it be
of holy writ, there should be no touches of the humorous,
however restrained and dignified its manifestation. Shrewd
insight into character, finding expression in phrases of homely
vigour, or tranquil irony, or two-edged sarcasm,—without much
of this, what were a book of proverbs? Assuredly the collected
proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel, are not
careful to eschew a touch of humour when the subject invites,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
or allows of, not to say requires it. Such a subject we have,
and such a touch of the jocose, in a verse which sets forth so
tersely the tactics of traffickers and bargain-makers; how the
bidder depreciates the wares he is bidding for, until they are
his; and how he alters his tone then, and brags at once of
their superior worth, and of his own superior skill in effecting
a purchase. He haggles, and beats them down, and pooh-poohs
them, as all but unsaleable, while yet they are on sale;
but so soon as the bargain is struck, he goes on his way
rejoicing, and perhaps calls his kinsfolk and acquaintance together,
to rejoice with him, for he has bought dirt cheap what
was worth its weight in gold. “It is naught, it is naught, saith
the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.”</p>

<p>The Paris of “Troilus and Cressida” compliments, or, as
may be, upbraids a subtle Greek with his dexterity in this line
of policy:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fair Diomede, you do as chapmen do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In measure with the intending buyer’s dispraise, is kept up
by the would-be seller a song of praise. As Horace has it,
<i>Laudat venales qui vult extrudere merces</i>; and the laudation is
apt to be in inverse proportion to the intrinsic worth of his
wares. Good wine may need no bush; but bad wine, on
that showing, may need one as big as a tree; and the wine
merchant is equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>A. K. H. B. has said of men in towns, aware of the value of
time, that by long experience they are assured of the uselessness
of trying to overreach a neighbour in a bargain, because
he is so sharp that they will not succeed. But in agricultural
districts such practical essayists in the art of overreaching are
declared to be common enough and to spare; and it is one of
the Recreations of the Country Parson aforenamed (initially
at least) to mark out in detail the course which these bargain-makers
are alleged invariably to follow. “If they wish to buy
a cow or rent a field, they begin by declaring with frequency
and vehemence that they don’t want the thing,—that in fact
they would rather not have it,—that it would be inconvenient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
for them to become possessors of it. They then go on to say
that still, if they can get it at a fair price, they may be induced
to think of it. They next declare that the cow is the very
worst that ever was seen, and that very few men would have
such a creature in their possession.” And so on,—till the
strenuous haggler, after wasting two hours, telling sixty-five
lies, and stamping himself as a cheat, ends the negotiation,
without taking anything at all by his petty trickery, so complicated
and so clumsy withal in its convolutions.</p>

<p>It is in his estimate of the real merits of English horses, that
Fuller discreetly observes, in meting out temperate but cordial
praise of their good points, “And whilst the seller praiseth
them too much, the buyer too little, the indifferent stander-by
will give them their due commendation.” What was true of
horseflesh and its breeders and purchasers, in old Fuller’s day
holds good still. Type of a large class is that manœuvring
major in a popular fiction, of whom, and of his, “bargains” in
the stable—mostly sedate, elderly animals—we read, that certainly,
if the animals could have spoken, they would have
expressed their surprise at the difference in the language used
by the major when a buyer and when a seller; for while, as a
buyer, he made them out to be, like Gil Blas’ mule, all faults,
as a seller he suddenly came round to believe in them as paragons
of perfection.</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt records as his experience of the Italians at home,
that to cheat you through thick and thin was the universal
endeavour—so that a perpetual warfare was inevitable, in which
you were obliged to fight in self-defence. “If you paid anybody
what he asked you, it never entered into his imagination
that you did it from anything but folly. You were pronounced
a <i>minchione</i> (a ninny), one of their greatest terms of reproach.
On the other hand, if you battled well through the bargain, a
perversion of the natural principle of self-defence led to a feeling
of respect for you.” Dispute might increase, it is added;
the man might grin, stare, threaten; might pour out torrents of
argument and of “injured innocence,” as they always do; but
be firm, and he went away equally angry and admiring. “Did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
anybody condescend to take them in, the admiration as well as
the anger was still in proportion, like that of the gallant knights
of old when they were beaten in single combat.” Such chaffering,
or “prigging,” as Burns calls it (in his satiric touch at
town councillors waddling down the street, in all the pomp of
ignorant conceit,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Men wha grew wise prigging owre hops and raisins),”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">such haggling, and stickling, and demurring, and deferring, are
too truly said to distinguish the British system of arranging
settlements—in which, embodying completely the Oriental
theory of marriage, a woman is dealt with “as a valuable
security, to be exchanged for due consideration.” A marriage
conducted according to the approved principles is therefore
“a matter of sharp, close bargaining. No sooner is the romantic
part of it over, than it is surrendered to the lawyers,
who proceed to chaffer over it and cheapen their adversary’s
claim, as they might do if they were purchasing a
cow.” A self-styled Oriental student of the modern Syrians,
in a book bearing that title, graphically sketches a representative
bargaining scene in a café at Damascus, between a
Christian indigo-dealer, in Beyrout costume, and a Jewish dyer;
the former pretending to feel insulted at being offered so low a
price, and the latter pretending to get into a passion at having
his time taken up with a fruitless negotiation. Captain Marryat’s
Travels in North America supply a plurality of parallel
passages; now of two misses “swopping” bonnets, with an
assumed indifference and a suppressed ardour almost ridiculous
enough to verge on the sublime; and now of a couple of Down-Easters,
whittling all the while they are bargaining, and doing
both with all their might and main. Fiction-writers who make
a study of character and manners are fond of introducing
scenes of this kind. Scott’s Antiquary chuckles over his feats
in cheapening old curiosities, and delights to tell how often he
has stood haggling on a halfpenny, lest, by a too ready acquiescence
in the dealer’s first price, he should be led to
suspect the value Mr. Oldbuck sets upon the article: “And
then, Mr. Lovel, the sly satisfaction with which one pays the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
consideration, and pockets the article, affecting a cold indifference,
while the hand is trembling with pleasure!” The
bargaining match with Maggie, the Fairport fishwife, is one
of the gems of the story. Mr. Charles Reade offers a racy
pendant in his trafficking encounter between Christie Johnstone,
the pride of Newhaven, and the four Irish merchants
who have agreed to work together, and to make a show of
competition, the better to keep the price down within bounds,
but who are no match for woman’s wit and woman’s tongue,
as exercised by Christie. The author of “Doctor Jacob” depicts
in Herr Schmidt a rosy, round man, with eyes that were
never in tune with his mouth; the former being sharp, Jewish,
and speculative; the latter, supine, commercial, and conservative:
“He made use of his eyes when he bought, and of his
mouth when he sold, giving his customers to understand that
he was the easiest going man in the world, only desirous of
small profits, and by no means miserable if a gold watch or
any other article went for half its value.” Canon Kingsley
enlivens the adventures of “Hereward” with a certain Dick
Hammerhand, the richest man in Walcheren, who tries to
overreach the hero, and fails to his cost; one stage of the
transaction taking this turn: “The less anxious the stranger
seemed to buy, the more anxious grew Dick to sell; but he
concealed his anxiety, and let the stranger turn away, thanking
him for his drink,” but anon renewing the treaty with as much
semblance of disregard as he could put on. The author of
“The Gayworthys” works up a clever bit of homely chaffering
between Mrs. Vorse and Widow Horke the strawberry-dealer.
And we find ourselves between a couple of horse-dealers again
in “Silas Marner:” “Bryce of course divined that Dunstan
wanted to sell the horse, and Dunstan knew that he divined it
(horse-dealing is only one of many human transactions carried
on in this ingenious manner); and they both considered that
the bargain was in its first stage, when Bryce replied ironically,
[to the other’s boast of a recent high bid,] ‘I wonder at that
now, I wonder you mean to keep him; for I never heard of a
man who didn’t want to sell his horse, getting a bid of half as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
much again as the horse was worth,’” etc. Trust Bryce to
boast of that horse, and of that bargain, so soon as he is gone
his way, the horse his, and the bargain made. It must be a
distorted type of human nature that resembles the discontented
man of Theophrastus, who, after taking a great deal of pains to
beat down the price of a slave, and after he has paid his money
for him,—instead of boasting, breaks out into the grumble, “I
am sure thou art good for nothing, or I should not have had
thee so cheap.” A companion picture, in its way, but with
the difference between an inveterate grumbler and an impenetrable
oaf, is that by Plautus of a fool with an old grange to
sell, of which property he advertises the singular attractions to
draw buyers to bid and buy. Nothing ever thrived on it, he
says; no owner of it ever died in his bed; the trees were all
blasted; the swine died of the measles, the cattle of the
murrain, the sheep of the rot; nothing was ever reared there,
not a duckling, or goose. <i>Hospitium fuit calamitatis.</i> It is
naught, it is naught, saith the buyer? No, the seller, in this
case.</p>

<p>Among the reminders and remonstrances which it was
the mission of the prophet, the son of Beeri, in the days
of Ahaz and Hezekiah, to deliver to Ephraim, there was this
significant passage, expressive of a reckless people’s unconscious
decline, whose lapses were taken account of on high,
and Ephraim knew it not—“Yea, gray hairs are here and
there upon him, yet he knoweth not.”</p>

<p>Who, asks Hartley Coleridge, ever saw their first gray hairs,
or marked the crow feet at the angle of their eyes, without a
sigh or a tear, a momentaneous self-abasement, a sudden sinking
of the soul, a thought that youth is fled for ever? “None
but the blessed few that, having dedicated their spring of life
to Heaven, behold in the shedding of their vernal blossoms a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
promise that the season of immortal fruit is near.” Gray hairs,
in an advancing stage of the plural number, may be here and
there upon us before we know of it. But the actual discovery
of the first is a bit of an epoch in one’s life; and if one
exclaims Eureka! it is hardly in the most jubilant of tones or
the most exultant of tempers.</p>

<p>Falstaff was surprised into a full purpose of amendment of
life when he lighted on the first white hair on his chin; but
only to keep on renewing the purpose weekly, long after chin
and head, too, must have been covered with silver or snow.</p>

<p>With some the humour is to pass off the discovery in seeming
glee; and perhaps it is the saturnine, melancholy temperament
that is likeliest to do this. For instance, Gerbier relates
of Charles the First, that one morning “as the King was combing
his head, he found a white hair, which he sent to the
Queen in merriment. Henrietta Maria immediately wrote
back that Don Carlos would cause many more to come up
before the Emperor gave up the Palatinate.” Had the King
not been himself combing his head on this not too auspicious
occasion, the probability is, as courts and courtiers go, that his
first white hair would not thus have been allowed to attract and
invite attention. A courtly dresser would have been shocked
to reveal what he saw, and would have kept the secret with
<i>ex officio</i> conscientiousness. Many and many are the uncrowned
heads upon which gray hairs are gathering here and
there—a familiar sight enough to overseeing (and not overlooking)
attendants or friends, but by the owners themselves
unsuspected as yet. Mrs. Browning lets Aurora Leigh espy
one such straggler, which even the neat-handed maid-in-waiting
overlooks, at Lady Waldemar’s toilet:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Her maid must use both hands to twist that coil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of tresses, then be careful lest the rich</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bronze rounds should slip:—she missed, though, a gray hair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A single one,—I saw it; otherwise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The woman looked immortal.”</div>

<p>It is among the graver of his Recreations that a clerical
essayist pictures to himself man or woman, thoughtful, earnest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
and pious, sitting down and musing, at the sight of the first
gray hairs. Here is the slight shadow, he puts it, of “a certain
great event which is to come;” the earliest touch of a chill
hand which must prevail at length. “Here is manifest decay:
we have begun to die. And no worthy human being will pretend
that this is other than a very solemn thought. And we
look backward as well as forward: how short a time since we
were little children, and kind hands smoothed down the locks
now grown scanty and gray.” So in Mrs. Southey’s (Caroline
Bowles’) tender, simple verses on the same trite theme:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some there were took fond delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sporting with these tresses bright,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Fingers now beneath the mould</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Woe is me!) grown icy cold.</div>
    <div class="center">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now again a shining streak</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Gins the dusky cloud to break;—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here and there a glittering thread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lights the ringlets, dark and dead—</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Glittering thread!—but <i>not</i> of <i>gold</i>.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Silent warning! silvery streak!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not unheeded dost thou speak.</div>

<p>Mr. Thackeray makes his youngish widow, Amelia Osborne,
take tranquilly enough this sort of revelation. “In these quiet
labours and harmless cares the gentle widow’s life was passing
away, a silver hair or two marking the progress of time on
her head, and a line deepening ever so little on her fair forehead.
She used to smile at these marks of time.” Which
accords with her placid temperament. Quite otherwise constituted
is Currer Bell’s Madame Beck. “A loud bell rang
for morning school. She got up. As she passed a dressing-table
with a glass upon it, she looked at her reflected image.
One single white hair streaked her nut-brown tresses; she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
plucked it out with a shudder.” That is an early phase of the
decadence of which Mr. Robert Browning graphically depicts
a later stage:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One day, as the lady saw her youth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Depart, and the silver thread that streaked</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her hair, and, worn by the serpent’s tooth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The brow so puckered, the chin so peaked—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She wondered who the woman was,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So hollow-eyed and haggard-cheeked.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Trollope’s Captain Cutwater is the representative of a
large constituency in at least this one salient particular, that he
“had no idea that he was an old man. He had lived for so
many years among men of his own stamp, who had grown
gray and bald and rickety and weak alongside of him,” that
when he moved into a younger circle, and settled there, he
ignored the disparity of ages. In Juvenal’s emphatic phrase,
old age steals upon us unawares,—unperceived, unrecognised:
<i>obrepit non intellecta senectus</i>. This stealthy in-coming, or on-coming,
of old age is an iterated topic in the classics. Cicero,
indeed, had been beforehand with Juvenal, almost word for
word: <i>non intelligitur quando obrepit senectus</i>. There is Ovid,
again, with his “stealthy lapse” of age, beguiling as it wears
away: <i>labitur occulte, fallitque volubilis ætas</i>; and with his elsewhere
reminder, that time glides on, and with noiseless years
we grow older till we grow old: <i>Tempora labuntur, tacitisque
senescimus annis</i>. Without, as Hazlitt says, our in the least
suspecting it, the mists are at our feet, and the shadows of
age encompass us. Leigh Hunt somewhere comments feelingly
on the difficulty of learning how narrow and dim a boundary
separates mature from old age; and quoting his own personal
experience, says, that a single illness made the line of demarcation
clear to him. So M. de Ste.-Beuve: <i>Rien n’est pénible à
démêler comme les confins des ages: il faut souvent que quelque
chose vienne du dehors et coupe court</i>.</p>

<p>There is all the more force in the kindly wish of Mr. Tennyson’s
Will Waterproof, that the plump object of it may live
long, ere from his topmost head the thickset hazel dies; long,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
ere the hateful crow shall tread the corners of his eyes; all the

</div>

<p>“He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and
he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.”
To be ruled by one’s angry spirit is cruel bondage indeed, for
that taskmaster never spares the lash. To rule or to be ruled,—that
is the question.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ira furor brevis est: animum rege; qui, nisi paret,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Marcus Antoninus, in his Meditations, calls rage and resentment
marks of an unmanly disposition; mildness and temper
being not only more humane, but, he contends, more masculine
too. And the philosophic emperor wrote and spoke as
one of, what Mr. Matthew Arnold calls, those</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... milder natures, and more free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom an unblamed serenity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath freed from passions, and the state</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of struggle these necessitate.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From that state of struggle many a victor emerges with
honourable scars, but deep. Famous and significant is the
story of the physiognomist who detected in the features of
Socrates the traces of that fiery temper which for the most part
he kept in severe control, but which, when it did break loose,
is described by those who witnessed it as absolutely terrible,
overleaping both in act and language every barrier of the
ordinary decorum of Grecian manners. Le Clerc’s <i>éloge</i> of
John Locke includes the remark that if he had any defect, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
was the being somewhat passionate; “but he had got the
better of it by reason, and it was very seldom that it did him
or any one else any harm.” Of Rudolf of Hapsburg we are
told that he was by nature warm and choleric, but that as he
advanced in years he corrected this defect. To some of his
friends, expressing their wonder that since his elevation to the
imperial dignity he had restrained the vehemence of his temper,
the founder of the House of Austria replied, “I have often
repented of being passionate, never of being mild and humane.”
One of Cromwell’s biographers reports his “temper exceeding
fiery; but the flame of it kept down for the most part, or soon
allayed with those moral endowments he had.” The admirable
Frederick Borromeo was admired for a placability, a sweetness
of manner nearly imperturbable, which, however, as Manzoni
reminds us, was not natural to the devout prelate, but was the
effect of continual combat against a quick and hasty disposition.
Lord Clarendon more than once in his autobiography, plumes
himself on having mastered and “suppressed that heat and
passion he was naturally inclined to be transported with.”
“They who knew the great infirmity of his whole family, which
abounded in passion, used to say he had much extinguished
the unruliness of that fire.” Lord Macaulay turns to the advantage
of his favourite chancellor the assertion of his detractors,
that the disposition of the great Somers was very far from being
so gentle as the world believed, that he was really prone to the
angry passions, and that sometimes, while his voice was soft,
and his words kind and courteous, his delicate frame was
almost convulsed by suppressed emotion. His brilliant advocate
is fain to accept this reproach as the highest of all eulogies.
Again: Sir Archibald Alison assures us of Sir Robert Peel,
that he was by nature afflicted with a most violent temper,
and that so extreme were his paroxysms of anger, when a
young man, that he used, while they were coming on, to shut
himself up alone till the dark fit was over. “By degrees,
however, he obtained the mastery of this infirmity, and this at
length so effectually that he passed with the world, at a distance,
as a man of a singularly cold and phlegmatic temperament.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
Lady Holland reports her distinguished father to have been
naturally choleric,—prefacing the statement by a reflection,
that, although it is not the part of a daughter to reveal faults,
yet a fault nobly repaired, or repented of, adds to the respect
and interest which a character inspires. By her showing, then,
Mr. Sydney Smith was by nature quick and hasty, but always
struggled against the failing, and made many regulations to
avoid exciting any such emotions; and when he did give way,
it often excited his biographer’s admiration to see him gradually
subduing his chafed spirit, and to observe his dissatisfaction
with himself till he had humbled himself and made his peace,
it mattered not with whom, groom or child. “He could not
bear the reproaches of his own heart.” So Mr. Henry Rogers
observes of Locke, and his success, by dint of “immense pains”
taken, in subjugating his choleric propensity, that his anxiety for
its complete subjugation appears in his never being so angry with
another as he always was with himself—for being angry. Those
who are conversant with the journal and letters of Dr. Chalmers,
may remember how often that good man takes himself to task
for infirmities of temper, and how strenuously he resolves to
strive to keep down every tendency to irritation when in company,
to “try to maintain a vigorous contest with this unfortunate
peculiarity of my temper,” to “school down every irritable
feeling;” and how remorsefully he records such instances as
getting “into a violent passion with Sandy,” and getting “ruffled
with Jane,” in a manner and to a degree “quite unchristian.”
Passages abound such as, “Now is the time for reflecting on the
evils of intemperate passion;” “erred egregiously this evening
in venting my indignation;” “I may at least ward off the
assaults of anger;” “erred in betraying my anger to my servant
and wife;” “constant visitations of indignancy; this exceedingly
wrong: there is not a greater foe to spirituality than
wrath.” “O my God, deliver me from all rancour and much
irritableness,”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> etc., etc. “Here,” to apply the lines of Wordsworth’s
son-in-law,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The pen is too truly said to be a fruitful source of regrets to
some of us, in regard of the outbreaks of temper we allow it to
put on paper; and never is the sting sharper, says one essayist,
than when we realize that our imprudence is in black and
white, beyond our reach, irrevocable. “We send off our letter,
to repent sometimes how bitterly!” <i>Litera scripta manet.</i>
Hence the advice of another, never to write in anger, or, at
any rate, to keep your letter till you are cool. We are recommended,
when indignant at any one’s conduct, to write a letter
couched in the strongest terms possible, as satirical and cutting
as we can make it, and having done this, to direct, seal, and
put it in our desk for a few hours, then read it for our own
satisfaction, and tear it up. Another popular authority, earnestly
deprecating angry letters, lays down as a rule to be
observed throughout the letter-writing world, that no angry
letter be posted till four and twenty hours shall have elapsed
since it was written. “We all know how absurd is that other
rule, of saying the alphabet when you are angry. Trash! Sit
down and write your letter; write it with all the venom in
your power; spit out your spleen at the fullest; it will do you
good: you think you have been injured; say all that you
can say with all your poisoned eloquence, and gratify yourself
by reading it while your temper is still hot. Then put it in
your desk, and, as a matter of course, burn it before breakfast
the following morning. Believe me that you will then have
a double gratification.” <i>Loquitur</i> the perhaps most widely
read, and without a perhaps the most prolific, writer of the
day.</p>

<p>When Cœur-de-Lion, in Scott’s “Talisman,” incensed and
mortified at the Templar’s tactics, yet foresaw the penalty of
giving way to his headlong resentment, with a strong effort he
remained silent till he had repeated a pater noster, that being
the course which “his confessor had enjoined him to pursue
when anger was likely to obtain dominion over him.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
familiar “count five-and-twenty, Tattycoram,” in one of Mr.
Dickens’ later stories is but another practical application of the
selfsame text.</p>

<p>Gibbon adds to his account of the public penance inflicted
by Ambrose on Theodosius, for the massacre of Thessalonica,
this remark: “and the edict which interposes a salutary interval
of thirty days between the sentence and the execution, may
be accepted as the worthy fruits of his [the emperor’s] repentance.”
For it was by a hasty resolve that Theodosius swore in
his wrath to expiate the blood of his lieutenant, Botheric, by
the blood of a guilty people; his fiery and choleric temper
being impatient of the dilatory forms of a judicial inquiry. In
hot haste he despatched the messengers of death; but attempted,
when it was too late, to prevent the execution of his own orders.
Avenging furiously in haste, he had to repent at leisure; and he
did repent.</p>

<p>It is impossible, perhaps, observed Dean Swift, for the best
and wisest among us to keep so constant a guard upon our
temper but that we may at some time or other lie open to the
strokes of fortune. Incensed on one occasion, “it was natural
for me to have immediate recourse to my pen and ink; but
before I would offer to make use of them, I resolved deliberately
to tell over a hundred; and when I came to the end of
that sum, I found it more advisable to defer drawing up my
intended remonstrance till I had slept soundly on my resentments.”
We are told of the celebrated Macklin, that although
so particular in drilling the performers at rehearsals, he was
scrupulous in keeping his temper down, the irritability of which
he knew too well; and that on one occasion he interposed an
hour by his stop-watch, all retiring together from the stage to
the green-room, at the end of which time all were in good
humour again, and the rehearsal was resumed. “When the
evil effects of hasty anger approach, the consequences of which
may be irretrievable,”—thus moralizes a fellow-craftsman, John
O’Keeffe,—“it would be no harm if all of us could suppress
our own feelings, even for Macklin’s green-room hour.” His
mighty master, Shakspeare, would have supplied him with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
precedent, in the case of good Duke Humphrey, who says as
he re-enters,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Now, lords, my choler being overblown</div>

<p>Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton’s secretary, Mr. Nixon, on his
own showing, could not refrain from blurting out just what he
felt at the moment, when differences arose between the two.
This used to vex Sir Thomas, who however would say nothing
till the next day, and then, when the secretary thought that the
whole matter had passed off (having perhaps received great
kindness in the meantime), the remonstrance would come out,
“What a silly fellow you were, Nixon, to put yourself in such
a passion yesterday! If I had spoken then, we should most
probably have parted. Make it a rule never to speak when
you are in a passion, but wait till the next day.” And we are
assured that, if at any time he happened to transgress this rule
himself, he was seriously vexed and grieved, and could not rest
till he had in some way made amends for his want of self-restraint.</p>

<p>Molière’s Arnolphe propounds the prophylactic rule with
emphasis and discretion:</p>

<p>Adam Smith observes, in his “Theory of Moral Sentiment,”
that, in the eye of nature, it would seem, a child is a more
important object than an old man, and excites a much more
lively, as well as a much more universal sympathy. “It ought
to do so,” he adds. “Everything may be expected, or at
least hoped, from the child. In ordinary cases, very little can
be either expected or hoped from the old man.” It is regretful,
remorseful eld that is supposed to utter the lament, in
gazing on childish faces and forms, heaven-encompassed infancy,—</p>

<p>Mrs. Trench writes to the poet of the “Pleasures of Memory,”
and with direct reference to that poem, “In looking back, the
only days I earnestly desire to recall, are those which glided
away while I was ‘girt with growing infancy,’ and read in the
eyes and the smiles of my children, who were affectionate and
beautiful, a promise of happiness, such as this world can never
fulfil.” A more vigorous poet than Samuel Rogers, has a vigorous
but gloomy stanza on the kindling emotions of young
motherhood, when the wife—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Blest into mother, in the innocent look,</div>

<p>The fallen young mother in Mrs. Gaskell’s story hails in her
child a new, pure, beautiful, innocent life, which she fondly
imagines, in the early passion of maternal love, she can guard
from every touch of corrupting sin by ever watchful and most
tender care. “And <i>her</i> mother had thought the same, most
probably; and thousands of others think the same, and pray
to God to purify and cleanse their souls, that they may be fit
guardians for their little children.”</p>

<p>Juvenal asks, “what morn’s so holy but its sun betrays theft,
perfidy, and fraud.” The thief, the betrayer, the cheat, was
once a child. Ovid urges the dissimilitude between such a
man and such a child: <i>dissimiles hic vir, et ille puer</i>. The Abbé
Delille expatiates on the attractions of each Spring-tide, and,
by affinity, of each new-born Day, as consisting in its refreshing
redolence of promise—“<i>qui ne nous fait que des promesses</i>.”

<p>George Eliot somewhere speaks of a promise void, like so
many other sweet, illusory promises of our childhood; void as
promises made in Eden before the seasons were divided, and
when the starry blossoms grew side by side with the ripening
peach—impossible to be fulfilled when the golden gates had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
been passed. Mr. Dickens says of the faint image of Eden
which is stamped upon our hearts in childhood, that it “chafes
and rubs in our rough struggles with the world, and soon wears
away; too often to leave nothing but a mournful blank remaining.”
Elia, the essay writer, is no way backward to own the
demerits and even delinquencies of himself as Elia, the middle
aged man; but for the child Elia, that “other me,” there, in
the background,—he must take leave to cherish the remembrance
of that young master—with as little reference, he protests,
to this stupid changeling of five-and-forty, as if it had
been a child of some other house, and not <i>his</i> father’s son.
“I know how it shrank from any the least colour of falsehood.
God help thee, Elia, how art thou changed! Thou art sophisticated.
I know how honest, how courageous (for a weakling)
it was—how religious, how imaginative, how hopeful. From
what have I not fallen, if the child I remember was indeed
myself!”</p>

<p>Stupid changelings of forty-five, their name is Legion, for
they are indeed many. Glance with Shenstone at the shiny
row of plump promissory faces in the dame school:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">As Milton, Shakspeare, names that ne’er shall die!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, to apply the words of Hazlitt, if we look back to past
generations (as far as eye can reach), we see the same fears,
hopes, wishes, followed by the same disappointments, throbbing
in the human heart; and so we may ever see them (if we
look forward) rising up for ever, and disappearing like vapourish
bubbles. Capable of application even are Joanna Baillie’s
lines assimilating the stupid changelings aforesaid to a dull cat
in contrast with its sprightly, mercurial kittenhood:—</p>

<p><i>Il y a en chacun de nous</i>, writes Sainte-Beuve, <i>un être primitif,
idéal, que la nature a dessiné de sa main la plus maternelle, mais
que l’homme trop souvent étoffe ou corrompt</i>. Mr. Kingsley, in a
touching reflection—literally reflection, looking back—on the
“long lost might-have been,” adverts to that personal idea
which every soul brings with it into the world, which shines
dim and potential in the face of every sleeping babe, before
it has been scarred, and distorted, and encrusted in the long
tragedy of life. Dr. Caird has said of the birthday of the
worst of men, that although it ushered a new agent of evil into
existence, and was a day fraught with more disastrous results
to the world than the day in which the pestilence began to
creep over the nations, or the blight to fasten on the food of
man, or any other physical evil to enter on a career of world-wide
devastation,—yet might this day, when the vilest of
humanity first saw the light, be in some aspects of it regarded
as better (despite Solomon’s text) than the day of his death.
“For, to take only one view of it, when life commenced, the
problem of good or evil, to which death has brought so terrible
a solution, was, in his case, as yet unsolved. The page of
human history which he was to write was yet unwritten, and to
that day belonged, at all events, the advantage of the uncertainty
whether it was to be blurred and blotted, or written fair
and clean.” Life, even in the most unfavourable circumstances,
it is urged, has ever some faint gleams of hope to brighten its
outset. The preacher owns that the simplicity, the tenderness,
the unconscious refinement that more or less characterize
infancy, even among the lowest and rudest, soon indeed pass
away, and give place to the coarseness of an unideal, if not the
animal repulsiveness of a sensual or sinful life. But he insists
that at least at the beginning, for a little while, there is something
in the seeming innocency, the brightness, the unworldliness,
the unworn freshness of childhood, that gives hope room
to work. Is there not, he asks, for every child, not in the
dreams of parental fondness only, but in reality, and in God’s
idea, the possibility of a noble future? “The history of each
new-born soul is surely in God’s plan and intention a bright<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
and blessed one. For the vilest miscreant that was ever
hounded out of life in dishonour and wretchedness, there was,
in the mind of the All-Good, a Divine ideal, a glorious possibility
of excellence, which might have been made a reality.”
The most hardened ruffian, the most obdurate criminal, the
most impenetrable reprobate, was once a child.</p>

<p>If it be a philosophical truth that the child is father of the
man—all that is now broadly emblazoned in the man having
been once latent—seen or not seen—as a vernal bud in the
child; it is not therefore true universally, as Mr. de Quincey
points out, that all which pre-exists in the child finds its development
in the man. “Rudiments and tendencies, which
<i>might</i> have found, sometimes by accident, <i>do</i> not find, sometimes
under the killing frost of counter forces, <i>cannot</i> find, their
natural evolution.” Most of what he has, the grown-up man
is shown to inherit from his infant self; but it does not follow
that he always enters upon the whole of his natural inheritance.
Childhood has been passionately apostrophized as</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EARS_TO_HEAR"><i>EARS TO HEAR.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> viii. 8.</p>

</div>

<p>“He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.” These words
cried Jesus, at the close of His parable of the Sower.
And He went on to say that to some, to the many, He spake
in parables, that seeing they might not see—not having eyes to
see; and that hearing they might not understand—not having
ears to hear in the Gospel sense. Nor in the Old Testament
sense; for these very words are cited from Isaiah; in Deuteronomy
too we read of those to whom the Lord hath not given
ears to hear; and in both Jeremiah and Ezekiel, of those who
have ears to hear, and hear not. One apostle laments the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
destiny of those to whom God hath given the spirit of slumber,
eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not
hear. And to another was entrusted the appeal, “He that
hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.” For only the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
The unwise is like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear. The
hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even
both of them.</p>

<p>Give but interest in the theme, and the listener’s ear fulfils
its natural function, that of hearing. “Mine ears hast Thou
opened.” Intensify the interest, and the listener is all ears, all
ear. Milton pictures a time—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“when, Adam first of men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To first of women, Eve thus moving speech,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn’d him, all ear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So again the attendant spirit in his “Comus”:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">“... I was all ear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And took in strains that might create a soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Under the ribs of Death.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Webster’s ill-starred Duchess of Malfi assures her brother, “I
will plant my soul in my ears to hear you.” <i>Je t’écoute sans
cligner la paupière</i>, exclaims Marillac, in “Gerfaut,” <i>dût ta
narration durer sept jours et sept nuits</i>. “Alarmed nature starts
up in my heart, and opens a thousand ears to listen,” cries
Colonel Talbot in an old play. Perplexed in the extreme, and
cut to the heart, by a revelation of household treachery and
wrong, an incredulous husband is described in a modern
romance, with his hands clasped together, and with his head
bent to catch every syllable of the harrowing news,—listening
“as if his whole being were resolved into that one sense of
hearing.” That reads like a literal translation of Balzac’s
description of one whose whole <i>vie se concentra dans le seul sens
de l’ouïe</i>. On another page he is not forgetful of <i>certains hommes</i>
who <i>se bouchent les oreilles pour ne plus rien entendre</i>. None so
deaf as those who will not hear. Next to them may rank
those who do not care to. The familiar narrative of “Eyes and
No Eyes” might easily have its pendent and parallel, point by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
point, and paragraph by paragraph, in one to be called <i>Ears
and No Ears</i>.</p>

<p>It is with hearing as with seeing. The eye is not satisfied
with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. Mendelssohn, in
one of his letters from abroad, rapturous with gazing on his
“favourite Titian,” declares that one “might well wish for a
dozen more eyes to look one’s fill at such a picture.” “Had I
three ears I’d hear thee!” exclaims Macbeth, when summoned
to attend by the apparition of an Armed Head, in the witches’
cave. Just as one of Plato’s epigrams expresses a wish for the
thousand eyes of the starry sky, that he might gaze his fill on
the star of his life:</p>

    <div class="verse indent22">εἴθε γενοίμην</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Οὐρανὸς, ὡς πολλοῖς ὄμμασιν ἐίς δὲ βλέπω.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Horace uses the expressive phrase, <i>bibit aure</i>, in one of his
odes—literally, “drink in with the ear”—a phrase admired
by the commentators for its lyric boldness. “I was all fixed
to listen,” says Dante, in the tenth gulf of <i>l’Inferno</i>. “O
speak your counsel now, for Saturn’s ear is all a-hungered,”
entreats the Titan, in Keats’s <i>Hyperion</i>. D’Artagnan, in the
ante-chamber of M. de Treville, is described as looking with all
his eyes and listening with all his ears, stretching his five senses
so as to lose nothing. The same author tells how Mazarin
listened, dying as he was, to Anne of Austria, as ten living men
could not have listened. “Will you listen?” asks a prince in
the same story; and is answered, “Can you ask me? You
speak of a matter of life or death to me, and then ask if I will
listen.”</p>

<p>When Falstaff asks the prince, “Dost thou hear me, Hal?”
“Ay, and mark thee too,” is the reply; and that there is a
difference between hearing and marking, between lending one
ear and giving both, Falstaff knew as well as most men. And
could practise what he knew, if occasion prompted. Witness
his wilful deafness when taken to task by the Lord Chief
Justice. “Boy, tell him I’m deaf,” he bids his page say. So,
“You must speak louder, my master’s deaf,” says the boy. “I
am sure he is, to the hearing of anything good,” rejoins the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
Chief Justice. And when, anon, his lordship taxes the incorrigible
knight with being deaf to what he is saying, Sir John
assures him, with that consummate assurance of his, that he
hears him very well: “Rather, an’t please you, it is the disease
of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled
withal.” Quite capable is that witty profligate of entering
into the import of each phrase in the collect on the Holy
Scriptures, which prays that we may in such wise hear them,
as to mark and learn, and inwardly digest them.</p>

<p>A late divine, treating of “animal men” in the “animal”
sense of St. Paul, as those who cannot discern spiritual things,
but are absorbed in animalism as their being’s end and aim,
affirmed that unavailing as it seems to be to talk to them of
religion, it avails no more talking of poetry, and art, or
speculative science, or the nobler things of the soul: “How
can such men discern the things of the Spirit? They understand
Tennyson as little as they understand St. Paul.” Having
ears they hear not anything so far away as the music of the
spheres. Of <i>that</i>, and such as that, the animal man might say,
by self-application of a couplet of Cowper’s,</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NOT_ALONE_IN_THE_VALLEY_OF_SHADOWS"><i>NOT ALONE IN THE VALLEY OF SHADOWS.</i></h2>

<p class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Psalm</span> xxiii. 4.</p>

</div>

<p>No good thing will He, from whom cometh every good
gift, withhold from them that love Him, and that
walk uprightly; least of all then His presence when most that
presence is indispensable,—as a <i>very</i> present help in trouble.
And when so indispensable as in the valley of the shadow of
death—darkening more and more unto the perfect night? We
must die alone. It is a truism, in its natural sense. But in
what the devout mind refuses to call or consider a non-natural
sense, the righteous hath companionship as well as hope in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
death. He who can say, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
not want, confines not his reliance to the range of green pastures
and still waters, but extends it to the glooms of the grave
and the swellings of Jordan. Not alone at the last, for the
Good Shepherd knoweth His sheep, and is known of them.
And how known? For one that will not let them want.
“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me; Thy rod and
Thy staff they comfort me.”</p>

<p>Pascal said that the solitude of death was the bitterest pang
of humanity; and because one must die alone, the end of life
is its heaviest trial. Some Frenchmen and Frenchwomen, very
French, have essayed, in their peculiar fashion, to elude the
disaster, simply by dying in public. People in Paris died in
public in the seventeenth century. Death, as Mr. Herman
Merivale puts it, was but the last scene of the play, to be
performed with a theatrical bow and exit. He shows us the
young beauty, perishing of dissipation, who made her adieux
to the world in appropriate costume and sentiments; and the
worn-out statesman, who might not turn his face to the wall in
peace, but was surrounded by a whole court in full dress, and
talked on till his husky accents could no longer convey the
last of his smart sayings to the listeners.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> With all his fribbles
and frivolities Horace Walpole was not quite Frenchified
enough to willingly face death in a French hotel, with all its
noise and excitement, “and, what would be still worse, exposed
to receive all visits; for the French, you know,” he writes to
Conway, “are never more in public than in the act of death.
I am like animals, and love to hide myself when I am dying”—which
refers to his periodical, and prolonged, and always
perilous attacks of gout. “If,” says the author of “Life in
the Sick-room,” “I could not trust my friends to save me from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
involuntary encroachment at the last, I had rather scoop myself
a hole in the sand of the desert, and die alone, than be tended
by the gentlest hands, and soothed by the most loving voices
in the choicest chamber.” Wordsworth’s Marmaduke exclaims,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Give me a reason why the wisest thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the earth knows shall never choose to die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But some one must be near to count his groans.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wounded deer retires to solitude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dies in solitude: all things but man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All die in solitude.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Special note has been taken of the exceptional characteristic
in the altogether exceptional career of the prophet Elijah, that,
in his last hour, when he was on his way to a strange and unprecedented
departure from this world—when the whirlwind
and flame chariot were ready, he asked for no human companionship.
“The bravest men are pardoned if one lingering
feeling of human weakness clings to them at the last, and they
desire a human eye resting on them—a human hand in theirs—a
human presence. But Elijah would have rejected all. In
harmony with the rest of his lonely severe character, he desired
to meet his Creator alone.” One hears of such preferences
now and then, in oddly constituted natures. Sir Walter Scott,
in a letter to his sister-in-law, appears to indicate a disposition
of this kind as prevalent in his father’s family. “Poor aunt
Curle,” he tells her, “died like a Roman, or rather like one of
the Sandy-Knowe bairns, the most stoical race I ever knew.
She turned every one out of the room, and drew her last
breath alone. So did my uncle, Captain Robert Scott, and
several others of that family.” Affectation was so inherent in
Chateaubriand’s confessions and professions, that one knows
not how far genuine may have been his plea for what he calls
the “necessity of isolation,” and its advantages in death as in
life. “Any hand is good enough to reach us the glass of
water that we call for in the fever of death. Ah! may that
hand not be too dear to us!” The “necessity of isolation”
reminds us of Keble’s query:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why should we faint and fear to live alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Since all alone, so Heaven has will’d, we die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor even the tenderest heart, and next our own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Knows half the reasons why we smile and sigh?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And that again reminds us, with a difference—the difference
between Madame de Staël and the sweet singer of the
“Christian Year,”—of Corinne on her death-bed, saying to
Castel Forte: “But for you, I should die alone. There is no
help for such a moment; friends can but follow us to the
brink; there begin thoughts too deep, too troublous, to be
confided.” <i>Mon sort est de mourir seul</i>, writes Rousseau’s bereaved
Solitaire; <i>et la seule Providence me fermera les yeux</i>.
Scott was not of mere imagination all compact when he
made Edie Ochiltree say, in the cave that forms the old mendicant’s
favourite retreat, “I hae had mony a thought, that
when I found myself auld and forfairn, and no able to enjoy
God’s blessed air ony langer, I wad e’en streek mysell out here,
and abide my removal, like an auld dog that trails its useless
ugsome carcass into some bush or bracken.” Montaigne says
that, might he have his choice, he thought he should like best
to die out of his own house, and away from his own people.
The Emperor Marcus Aurelius, on the seventh day of his last
illness, admitted none but his unworthy son (Commodus) to
his chamber, and after a few words dismissed him, “covered
his head for sleep, and”—in Dean Merivale’s words—“passed
away alone and untended.” Epigrammatic historians love to
tell of Catherine the Great, who had reigned over five hundred
and forty towns, over forty-two governments, over a multitude
of isles of the sea from Kamschatka to Japan, and over eighty
millions of slaves, that she died alone, entirely alone, without
a single slave at hand to support her drooping head. The
picture is meant to be sensational, and as written in French
and for the French, it may be telling enough. It tells, for
instance, upon such a nature as Madame Sophie Gay, who
used to promise her friends to come and die among them,
when it was her turn and her time; adding, in her very French
style, “Je ne veux pas que cette demoiselle”—meaning <i>la mort</i>—“me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
trouve seule.” Upon others, the grand climax of supreme
solitude fails of effect. “It has always been my wish,” writes
Southey, for example, “to die far from my friends, to crawl
like a dog into some corner and expire unseen. I would
neither give nor receive unavailing pain.” When death overtook
St. Francis Xavier, he was on board of a vessel bound
for Siam, and at his own request he was removed to the shore,
that he might die with the greater composure. Stretched on
the naked beach, with the cold blasts of a Chinese winter
aggravating his pains—thus Sir James Stephen describes his
last moments—he contended alone with the agonies of the
fever which wasted his vital power. “It was an agony
and a solitude for which the happiest of the sons of men
might well have exchanged the dearest society, and the purest
of the joys of life.... It was a solitude thronged by
blessed ministers of peace and consolation, visible in all
their bright and lovely aspects to the now unclouded eye of
faith; and audible to the dying martyr through the yielding
bars of his mortal prison-house, in strains of exulting joy till
then unheard and unimagined.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thou must go forth alone, my soul, thou must go forth alone,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To other scenes, to other worlds, that mortal hath not known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou must go forth alone, my soul, to tread the narrow vale;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But He, whose word is sure, hath said His comforts shall not fail.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His rod and staff shall comfort thee across the dreary road,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till thou shalt join the blessed ones, in Heaven’s serene abode.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. de Quincey has finely said of solitude, that, although it
may be silent as light, it is, like light, the mightiest of agencies;
for solitude is essential to man. “All men come into this
world <i>alone</i>; all leave it <i>alone</i>. Even a little child has a dread,
whispering consciousness, that, if he should be summoned to
travel into God’s presence, no gentle nurse will be allowed to
lead him by the hand, nor mother to carry him in her arms,
nor little sister to share his trepidations.” King and priest, we
are further reminded, warrior and maiden, philosopher and
child, all must walk those mighty galleries alone. The solitude,
therefore, which this author describes as in this world appalling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
or fascinating a child’s heart,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> is but the echo of a far deeper
solitude, through which already he has passed, and of another
solitude, deeper still, through which he <i>has</i> to pass: reflex of
one solitude—prefiguration of another.</p>

<p>Crabbe says of man that, feeling his weakness, it is his habit
to run to society, to numbers,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Himself to strengthen, or himself to shun;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But though to this our weakness may be prone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let’s learn to live, for we must die, alone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among the pangs which belong to death is emphatically
reckoned by F. W. Robertson, in his sermon on Victory over
it, the sensation of loneliness which attaches to that transit
through the valley of shadows. Have we ever, he asks, seen
a ship preparing to sail with its load of pauper emigrants to a
distant colony? for that is keenly suggestive of the desolation
which comes from feeling unfriended on a new and untried
excursion. He dilates on all beyond the seas being to the
ignorant poor man a strange land—away from the helps and
friendships and companionships of life, scarcely knowing what
is before him; and it is in such a moment, when a man stands
upon a deck, taking his last look of his fatherland, that there
comes upon him what the preacher calls “a sensation new,
strange, and inexpressibly miserable—the feeling of being
alone in the world. Brethren, with all the bitterness of such a
moment, it is but a feeble image when placed by the side of
the loneliness of death. We die alone. We go on our dark
mysterious journey for the first time in all our existence, without
one to accompany us. Friends are beside our bed, they
must stay behind. Grant that a Christian has something like
familiarity with the Most High, <i>that</i> breaks this solitary feeling;
but what is it with the mass of men? It is a question full of
loneliness to them.” Says the elder Humboldt (Wilhelm), in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
one of his letters: “However many companions a man may
have in the active sympathising world, he must ever make the
journey which leads across the boundaries of earthly things
alone; no one may accompany him.” Not but that in some
moods, and in some sense, this contemplative philosopher
might have assented to the protest of Paul Flemming, that had
we spiritual organs, to see and hear things now invisible and
inaudible to us, we should behold the air thronged with the
departing souls of that vast multitude which every moment
dies. For, “truly the soul departs not alone on its last
journey, but spirits of its kind attend it, when not ministering
angels; and they go in families to the unknown land. Neither
in life nor in death are we alone.” But then as we have <i>not</i>
the spiritual organs in question, the fact of conscious isolation
<i>in articulo mortis</i> is not affected; and their character, after all,
pertains rather to spiritualism than to spirituality.</p>

<p>A latter-day Christian lyrist expatiates on the sense of loneliness
one has at midnight, in the dread calmness of the dark,—or
again, on pathless hills, when the sun is set, and the ear
listens in vain for some social sound from afar. But,—</p>

<p>One can hardly quit this subject without recalling the awful
significance of a cry that once expressed, if one may say it,
inexpressible anguish,—anguish indescribable, incommunicable,—“My
God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken Me!” Penultimate
words, these were; and appalling in their suggestiveness
of uttermost desolation. But not the last words of all.
He was not alone, consciously not alone, at the very last.
Later than these, and triumphant over these—however subdued
and serene the triumph—came those other words, Divinely
calm, as became the Speaker,—“Father, into Thy hands I

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Plentiful illustrations might be drawn from Plutarch to the same effect.
There is Mutius Scævola, for instance, addressing Porsenna: “Your
threatenings I regarded not, but am subdued by your generosity.” There
is Porsenna himself, who, as Publicola found, could not be quelled by
dint of arms, but whom he converted into a friend to Rome, by “the
gentle arts of persuasion.” There is young Alexander, afterwards to be, or
to be called, the Great, whose astute father saw that he did not easily
submit to authority, because he would not be forced to anything, but that
he might be led to his duty by the gentler hand of reason; and therefore, as
a wise father, who knew his own son, Philip took the method of persuasion
rather than of command.</p>

<p>What Plutarch says of the gentler hand of reason, reminds us of Swift’s
account of the <i>Houyhnhnms</i>, that “they have no conception how a
rational creature can be compelled, but only advised or exhorted.” And
by the way, Swift remarks in a letter on England’s harsh rule over the Irish,
“Supposing even the size of a native’s understanding just equal to that of
a dog or a horse, I have often seen these two animals civilized by rewards
at least as much as by punishments.”</p>

<p>But to return to Plutarch. There is his Flaminius, again, whose appointment
to the command in the war with Macedon, he calls very fortunate for
Rome, since what was required was “a general who did not want to
do everything by force and violence, but rather by gentleness and persuasion.”
As Claudian says, <i>Peragit tranquilla potestas quad violenta nequit</i>.</p>

<p>Fear, observes Adam Smith, is in almost all cases a wretched instrument
of government, and ought in particular never to be employed against
any order of men who have the smallest pretensions to independency. “To
attempt to terrify them, serves only to irritate their bad humours, and
to confirm them in an opposition which more gentle usage perhaps might
easily induce them, either to soften, or to lay aside altogether.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> The history of Latin Christianity supplies abundant examples, more or
less pertinent. Columban and his disciples are characterized as having had
little of the gentle and winning perseverance of missionaries: they had
been accustomed to dictate to trembling sovereigns; and their haughty and
violent demeanour provoked the pagans, instead of weaning them from
their idolatries (iii. 106). So of Boniface (v. 167): it was in the tone of a
master that he commanded the world to peace, a tone which provoked
resistance. “It was not by persuasive influence, which might lull the
conflicting passions of men, and enlighten them as to their real interests.”
Contrast with these the temper and policy of Pope Eugenius III. (iii. 407),
whose “skilful and well-timed use of means more becoming the head of
Christendom than arms and excommunications, wrought wonders in his
favour;” and who, by his gentleness and charity, gradually supplanted the
senate in the attachment of the Roman people: “the fierce and intractable
people were yielding to this gentler influence.” On a later page we come
across the able portraiture of our Henry II., as drawn by a churchman who
was warning Becket as to the formidable adversary he had undertaken to
oppose: “He will sometimes be softened by humility and patience, but
will never submit to compulsion,” etc. Ariste <i>a raison</i> when he counsels

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Another type of mind, deficient in the higher attributes of independence,
is often feverishly eager to sink its sense of individual responsibility by
seeking what is called “rest in the Church.” Dr. Bungener represents his
Julian, when committed to the Bastile, as rather rejoicing at than terrified
by the despotism of the hand laid upon him; and in the same way, on taking
holy orders, he, being “subdued in heart, enslaved in mind, tired of being
his own master, only to create his own torments,” flatters himself that he
gives the Church complete power over his faculties at the same time that he
gives her plenary power over his actions.</p>

<p>To the baser sort, remarks Sir James Stephen, no yoke is so galling as
that of self control, no deliverance so welcome as that of being handsomely
rid of free agency. “With such men mental slavery readily becomes a
habit, a fashion, and a pride. To the abject many the abdication of self-government
is a willing sacrifice.”</p>

<p>One of our acutest essayists on social subjects comments on the readiness
of a man to exult in the fact that he has done something which he cannot
undo, and has pledged himself to a course from which he cannot draw back,
as more commonly the sign of a weak than of a strong nature. “The
comfort of plunging right into the stream is unspeakable to anybody who
has been accustomed to stand shivering and irresolute on the bank.” When
a person of this sort, it is justly observed, has brought himself to take the
plunge, his exultation and fearlessness are wonderful: the knowledge that
the Rubicon is crossed, and the die cast, seems to relieve him from
the necessity of further resolution. “He has set in motion a machine
which will of itself wind off results and consequences for him without
more ado on his own part; and this is an order of release from
the demands of circumstances upon his will, for which he cannot be too
thankful.”</p>

essay on Humility and Independence in his valuable “Notes from Life.”
The man of true humility, we are there taught, will come to the task of
judgment, on serious occasions, not lightly or unawed, but praying to
have “a right judgment in all things;” and whilst exercising that judgment
in no spirit of compromise or evasion, he will feel that to judge his
brother is a duty and not a privilege; and he will judge him in sorrow,
humbled by the contemplation of that fallen nature of which he is himself
part and parcel. (See “Notes from Life” (1847), pp. 46, <i>sqq.</i>)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> Mr. Thackeray incidentally opposes the quasi-apologists for smuggling
on the ground that it is a complicated tissue of lying. In his very last and
unfinished work, he makes a good old rector allow that to run an anker of
brandy may seem no monstrous crime; but when men engage in these
lawless ventures, who knows how far the evil will go? “I buy ten kegs
of brandy from a French fishing-boat, I land it under a lie on the coast, I
send it inland ever so far, and all my consignees lie and swindle. I land
it, and lie to the revenue officer. Under a lie (that is, a mutual secrecy),
I sell it to the landlord of the Bell at Maidstone, say.... My
landlord sells it to a customer under a lie. We are all engaged in crime,
conspiracy, and falsehood; nay, if the revenue looks too closely after us,
we out with our pistols, and to crime and conspiracy add murder. Do you
suppose men engaged in lying every day will scruple about a false oath in a
witness-box? Crime engenders crime, sir.”—<i>Denis Duval</i>, chap. vii.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> From Sir Walter Scott we might gather numerous examples and
aphorisms to the purpose. “It’s a sair judgment on a man,” says Ratcliffe,
in the “Heart of Mid-Lothian,” “when he has once gane sae far wrang as
I hae dune”—the present thief-taker being in fact an ex-thief—that never a
bit “he can be honest, try’t whilk way he will.” The career of Effie
Deans, anon Lady Staunton, in the same story, is a practical sermon on the
same text. “I drag on,” she owns, “the life of a miserable impostor, indebted
for the marks of regard I receive to a tissue of deceit and lies, which
the slightest accident may unravel.” Her sister, on perusing the letter
which contains these confessions, is impressed with such an instance of the
staggering condition of those who have risen to distinction by undue arts,
and the “outworks and bulwarks of fiction and falsehood, by which they
are under the necessity of surrounding and defending their precarious
advantages.”</p>

<p>Then again there is old Caleb Balderstone, querulous at being what he
calls “forced” to imperil his soul “wi’ telling ae lee after another faster than
I can count them,”—and elsewhere at the “cost” of “telling twenty daily
lees to a wheen idle chaps and queans, and, what’s waur, without gaining
credence.”</p>

<p>And for another instance we have the titular Earl of Etherington, in “St.
Ronan’s Well,” in the position as of a spider when he perceives that his
deceitful web is threatened with danger, and sits balanced in the centre,
watching every point, and uncertain which he may be called upon first to
defend. “Such is one part, and not the slightest part, of the penance
which never fails to wait on those, who, abandoning the ‘fair play of the
world,’ endeavour to work out their purposes by a process of deception and
intrigue.”</p>

<p>In one of Mr. Disraeli’s earlier fictions, there is a young man whose
frankness is proverbial, but who finds himself involved in a course of prevarication—due
effect being given to its preliminary process, though “only
the commencement of the system of degrading deception which awaited
him.”</p>

<p>But perhaps the most direct and forcible illustration of the subject in
modern fiction, is to be found in the “White Lies” of Mr. Charles Reade, a
work the title of which declares its didactic scope. Rose Beaurépaire in an
unguarded moment equivocates, or tells a white lie, and thereby hangs the
tale. Soon we have her bitterly bewailing the imbroglio in which she has
involved herself and others, and the necessity of fresh fibs to maintain the
meaning and credit of the first. “There is no end to it,” she sobs despairingly.
“It is like a spider’s web: every struggle to be free but
multiplies the fine yet irresistible thread that seems to bind me.” In the
next chapter a significant paragraph intimates, “This was the last lie the
poor entangled wretch had to tell that morning.” And the penultimate
chapter opens with a notice anew of the “fatal entanglement” into which
two high-minded sisters had been led, through yielding to a natural foible:
the desire, namely, to hide everything painful from those they loved, even
at the expense of truth. The author lays stress on the inextricable complications
due to their “amiable dishonesty,” and he importunes the reader to
take notice that after the first White Lie or two, circumstances overpowered
them, and drove them on against their will. It was no small part, he
insists, of all their misery, that they longed to get back to truth and could
not.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
